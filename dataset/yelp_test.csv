Fun! I like all the pretzel options & lemonade choices. Good little stop before the movies so you can fill the void & not drain your wallet at the concession stand.,4
"How does a company try to make you a customer for life? By treating you the way I was just treated by John.
I purchased a 3 pack of ink for my printer & on one of the cartridges the tiny little curcuit board had come off rendering it unuseable.
I brought the cartridge in to ""exchange"" it. John refunded the original 3 pack & gave me the new 3 pack and said "" sorry for your troubles"".
But I only need the yellow the other 2 work fine. To which John replies ""don't worry about it. Have a great day"".
Wow. I just had a conversation last night with some Yelp* buds about customer service and low & behold John & OfficeMax did it right. All I wanted was a hassle free exchange & ended up being treated amazingly well.
Thanks John for reinstilling the belief that customer service is not dead.
Amazing service. 5 Stars.",5
"Excellent service! Personable, thorough, efficient and the price was reasonable. We highly recommend them.",5
Luke Allen gave me the best massage I have ever had.  I was in a motorcycle accident a month ago and upon arrival Luke gave me a consult and performed the most therapeutic massage I have ever had. Luke was attentive to the areas of soreness we could work on and magical in working the areas which needed tender care. I feel 100% better and will be scheduling regular appointments.  The massage room was very calming and Luke made sure temperature and music were perfect for me. Luke is a very kind and considerate person and the ultimate professional. He truly loves what he does and his goal is to make his clients feel better walking out than when they walked in. Highly recommend.  VIP prices very reasonable and no contract required.,5
I've been here 2x wasn't impressed the first time figured give them a second try. There latte doesn't impress me I'd rather goto the Starbucks adjacent to this spot,3
"As I was driving to work today, one of your trucks had lost some poles out of the back of it while making a left turn. A young man hopped out the passenger side. Pulled all the poles out of the intersection so we could all pass before placing them back into his truck. We were wondering why the driver didn't hop out and help and as we passed we realized he was the driver. I really commend him for his smarts and safety. I am unsure if this is a safety procedure you teach all your drivers but I was amazed at his ability to handle it without causing delays. I am unsure of his name but with employees like that you must have a well oiled team!",5
"Awesome sooo delicious and great service. 
Enjoying a dinner spread. 
Small place but staff very efficient",4
"Clean, fast, friendly, nicest subway in the area.",4
Great food and fun atmosphere.  Nothing bad to say here!  This is a must do for every trip to Vegas.  Very reasonable pricing.,4
"This location sucks. They advertise to be open for guest services Monday-Saturday. So i called earlier this week to make an appointment, i must have called like 9 times and only twice did someone ever answer. And when I asked about scheduling something for a Tuesday, the woman said the students were busy all day on Tuesdays. So why advertise you are open Mon-Sat?
Annoyed!",1
I love this establishment! I makes me fill all Great Gatsby every time I go. I love the hostess Ingrid!!! She always remembers me when I come to town and she always has a joke to put a smile on my face. This is my secret place to bring all my friends to when I'm in the city! I'm even looking to have my bridal party here for drinks soon. Keep up the good work you guys! Im throughly impressed,5
Delicious!!! My favorite was #11 Thali. I would add fluffy bread instead of the flat. And Samosa Chaat. Yum!!!,5
Simply amazing.  Im a food snob. Especially when it comes to ethnic foods.  Great services. Food was spectacular. Might be my new fav place!!!!  I had chicken pho and the calamari.  Five stars!!!!,5
I came in at 4:15 pm and only 1 young lady was working as fast and as hard as she could. Someone had called in sick and she was on her own. Cudos to this girl! It took me 35 minutes to get two smoothies because it was so busy. Several customers walked out. I should have been one as well. It is unfortunate that the owners do not manage the place very well.,2
"What a great little gem in Avon.  This was our first visit since we are new here and we are happy to have a great park to see baseball games.  The $3 parking fee is reasonable and seats are not expensive.   Take your stadium cushion as the seats are hard.   The park is clean and employees are nice.  On Tuesday's much of the food is $2, but otherwise it's not overly priced.   We got seats right behind home plate, but found the netting to be too thick as we couldn't see the balls once they were hit.  Next time we will choose a different seat location.   Also, no beverage holders on the seat backs.

Overall, nice venue, very clean and inviting.",4
This is by far my favorite boba spot in town. Everyone is so friendly and as you become a regular they remember your drink and how you like it. I come here everyday to get my daily boba fix. Brew tea has something about the atmosphere that just makes you feel welcome. Can't wait to see the business grow,5
"I took my son here yesterday for his first ever haircut. The space is nice and bright, lots of things around to keep the kids entertained and distracted. Unfortunately the haircut and customer service were both awful. Our ""stylist"", Veronika, took about two seconds to examine my son's long, curly hair before she started cutting. I had wanted it cleaned up but kept on the long side, what we ended up with is an awful, Dorothy Hamill type bowl cut. I told her she was taking too much length off and she didn't even pause or look up. Nor did she spend any time when she was finished to check her work to see how it looked. I was clearly unhappy with the cut, yet none of the five people behind the counter would make eye contact with us, let alone ask if we were satisfied. It was clear they didn't want to deal with the problem and wanted us out as quickly as possible. 
This was a disappointing experience in every way, and I am so sad when I look at my sweet son's ridiculous haircut! I wouldn't even think of going back there for a fix, that's how low the skill level was. Visit at your own risk.",1
Love this place! (Used to love it a ton more when rainbow rolls were on happy hour!) Nonetheless still a staple in our sushi habits! Happy hour still kicks ass! Check out the karaoke bar in the back!,4
Tasty. Service was prompt. Appreciated the TVs to watch games on. Food was good for a brewery.,4
"I went to a play at the Plaza last night.  This review is for the casino and and renovations only.

The Plaza is pretty much the same as it was before but new.  There is new carpeting, new slot machines, and new table game pit tables.  The layout is the same as before, but it has a fresher look.  They are also putting a nice scent into the air and the place wasn't smoky last night like it used to be.  The air flow must have been improved.

The new Insurgo Theatre Movement theatre is on the 3rd floor next to the bingo room.  The theatre was a cabaret from the looks of what I saw last night.  It's odd to go to a play and have a nicely dressed cocktail waitress delivering drinks while actors are delivering lines (well only once).  She was also sufficiently unclothed to be worthy of the title of a Las Vegas cocktail server.  She was also really pleasant.

The garage is still the awful thing it's always been.  The 2nd floor was mostly blocked off because this is Bikefest 2011 (motorcycles), so they had an area reserved for those noise makers.

There was a lot of security everywhere last night and Metro and they may be due to the Bikefest,

I won't be a regular at the Plaza.  Why drive 10 miles when there's a much nicer place a mile from home.  I will go to see plays there, but that will be about it.",3
Superb experience. Get there early and don't miss the hand squeezed OJ and apple fritters.,5
"My wife made dinner reservations online, a week in advance for NYE. We arrived about 10 minutes early and saw another couple just staring at the front door. We obviously asked them what was going on and they pointed to the front door where there was a sign stating that V. Picasso was closed for NYE due to a wedding. My jaw dropped as did my wife's. It's not like it was a regular old night, this was New Years Eve and again, we made reservations a week prior. The other couple just hung their heads low and walked off. 

I entered the business and spoke to the bartender and explained what had happened. The bartender was just as stunned as I was and did everything he could to apologize for the businesses error and after seeing how disappointed I was, handed me a gift certificate for $20. I thanked him for it, and for how he handled the situation and walked away. 

My wife and I tried Hamilton Walkers but their reservations were full as were several other restaurants in the area. Just when we thought our NYE date was over, Bacaro came to the rescue and was able to fit us in. We were very grateful four our NYE rescue. 

We have eaten at V. Picasso several times in the past with mixed reviews, but their NYE failure will be forever noted. I will give them one more chance since I have a gift certificate, and will go from there.  But I will never forget the unacceptable experience on NYE.",1
"My A/C went out during a typical July heatwave in Vegas. My home warranty company is AHS, and they sent Air Pro Master to take a look.

Roman came to the rescue, and - along with his assistant - had my air up and running in no time. I was impressed that Roman took the time to show me the part he replaced and thoroughly explained what was wrong with the unit. He had an upbeat and pleasant attitude, and I felt he was approachable with the questions I had. It has been a week, and my air is still running perfectly.

I deducted one star because there was some difficulty in making initial contact and lack of clarity about when my appointment was (meaning I sat in a hot house all day, thinking they were showing up that day, but it was actually supposed to be the next day).

Overall, Air Pro Master is a fine company, and Roman is an outstanding tech.",4
"A place calling itself ""Veg Kitchen "" should be serving fresh vegetables. Unfortunately, the skimpy vegetable portions in each dish were either frozen or canned. Very disappointing . By the way, my wife's dish tasted suspiciously like Rice-A-Roni.",2
"Walked upstairs to the sounds of the DJ sampling a Billie Holliday-ish sound-alike, saw 2001: A Space Odyssey playing on the screen, and knew I was hooked. 

It's hip yet laid back and serves PHX well. Seating was abundant and comfortable. Service was quick but I'm subtracting points for dousing one of my JWBs with Coke instead of a splash of water. Still, with the atmosphere and music, SideBar was one of my favorite spots in town. (Where's my ascot!?! (:D))

I didn't mind the walk from the rail but if you find yourself with a group that can't hoof more than a few blocks without complaining, then hail a cab. 

4.1 Stars.",4
Server told us to hurry up just as we were finish eating because there was a reservation. That's not our problem. That's very rude whether you are a server or not. Never coming here again and telling everyone about this bad service,1
"We are from Los Angeles.  If you like Raffi's in Glendale, you will definitely like this place.  Actually, I think their Chicken Koobideh and the Ground Beef Koobideh are better than Raffi's.
The service is unmatched by anyone!!
Now that we found this great place, we'll be back every time we come to Vegas!",5
nice place.  They had a great guitar player that we listened to while having a drink for my wife's birthday.,4
"This is one of our favorite places but last night was a complete disappointment. The beer and Jalapeño Infused Margarita were the highlights. Our Queso Dip was just warm but I decided to ignore that. We ordered the Shrimp Fajitas, maybe my expectations were too high, but no sizzling plate. There was no flavor at all to the dish. I rechecked the menu and it did say SEASONED SHRIMP.  My seven shrimp were as white as could be with no sight of seasoning anywhere. My wife couldn't eat it so she ordered the Chicken Burrito. Our daughter had ordered this before and enjoyed it so it seemed like a safe bet. WRONG! Another Luke warm flavorless dish. The ratio of chicken to rice was won by the RICE!  Out of 10......Chicken 2...Rice 8!! I told our waiter Luka who said he would tell the kitchen but I never heard anything more.  I'm sure we will be back, after a while, but it'll just be Tacos!",2
"The best Mexican food in town... yelped and can came here for lunch... 
taste just awesome. 
Service great.
Very clean place. 
People amazing. 
Wow enchilada sauce were just pure heaven. 
Everything amazing.",5
"One of the best BBQ places I've ever been to.  There was a huge wait, but it was totally worth it.  I recommend to everyone!",4
My family and friends have used Thank-Q Rentals for everything from weddings to parties and are always satisfied. Doug and his crew are always helpful and his prices are very fair. You will not be disappointed.,5
"It was a pretty good location for walking and driving. Valet service worked well.  Room was somewhat oddly decorated. The clear high point for us was eating at Urban Farmer restaurant attached to the hotel, which was really just by chance and where I would likely eat again.",4
"My God, you need a microscope to see the food.  Don't go by the photos, they must be supersized!  This is the perfect example of a place with a great rep not living up.  It's all show.  The food was ok, .....except you have to order 3 of everything.  Service was also very slow.  On a Tuesday night.",1
"I debated on eating at this restaurant but now after finishing my meal I wish I had just passed on it. The food was really good but the service, the service was not good. Not sure I can pinpoint why, but our waitress was just not that interested in us it seemed. We were half way through our food before I sent the hostess to get her so we could get cheese shredded on our pastas. The bread was free but we didn't ask for it so we didn't get any UNTIL we asked, bad service. We waited for our checks as well. There are too many options in this hotel and on the strip to get bad service and return. But let me be clear the food was excellent. Word of advise ASK if the food you're ordering comes with pasta not everything does.",2
"3.5 stars.

It's a good on-the-go cheap eat if you're in a rush and if you work (or happen to be) in the area. It's not the best sushi, but the prices are affordable and you also get freshly made sushi for decent prices as well!",4
Delighted with this place!!! The chef knows what he is doing and the service is excellent. You will not be disappointed. We had the blackened salmon salad and the chef surprised us with a special treat! Ask for the chefs recommendation! Be ready for a great dish and experience.,5
"Petite , overload with latest trends prices great love it",5
My favorite boba place. Love getting the Okinawa with salt Cream. You can also tell them how sweet you want your drink to be and they have almond milk. They use real fruit for their slushes/smoothies - try the taro and mango slushes and the Boba is delicious! I always ask for extra Boba. I just wish they had Larger drink sizes.,5
This is some good stuff!! Pizza is good meatball sub is amazing and apple vinaigrette is the best!!! Wings could be crispier.. But everything else is soooo good! And they deliver!,4
Some of the rudest employees. Attendant asked me which wash I wanted as I was trying to read the screen. I politely replied that I wasn't sure yet. He came back with well if you don't know then I don't know either. He was not joking either. 2 stars only because the wash was pretty goo,2
I took a premiere pro course at Lumenbrite in order to fill in the gaps in knowledge as well as expand my ability in video production.  The information was present extraordinarily well and moved at a great pace.  We built a project in the class that had a great deal of real world application and demonstrated a great workflow.  It definitely gave me the know-how to work comfortably in premiere.,5
Erica was so helpful and awesome. I had to make baby shower party favors in a card stock form and was unsure on what paper looked best. She jumped right in and suggested the paper as well as erasing the borders so it wouldn't come out on the card itself. The card came out beautifully and she even helped me cut them up. Thanks Erica!,5
"There's only one person in Scottsdale that I truly trust with my eyebrows and that is Courtenay Weitzel. She's quite talented at what she does and I always enjoy my time with her as she's very personable. 

If you're like me and don't feel a uni-brow suits your look go see Courtenay. She'll take good care of you.",5
"My family and I just went here for the first time and I could not have had more fun! I was the only one that has never shot a gun before and it had been well over a decade since my parents had shot, so we decided to get lessons from John B and it was perfect! He was so knowledgeable and friendly and instantly put me at ease when it was my turn to shoot. He had us try different types and sizes of guns so we could feel the difference and find ""the one"". John went above and beyond to make this a good time. Overall this was a fantastic experience and I would definitely recommend Green Valley Range and John B to anyone who is considering this!",5
Great bar. My girlfriend and I like to stop here a couple times a month when we want to try something different! The atmosphere inside the bar is very swanky and intimate. The main reason we stop in is for the beer selection. They have many beers and house drinks you just can't get anywhere else. I highly recommend you check this place out!,5
"Be prepared to wait 45 minutes for 3 burritos!!! Oh and it'll also cost you a small fortune. 

This place was great when it first opened but it has gone down hill. Hoping the business reads the reviews and makes some changes.",1
"Charming and great service. Favorable menu items that can be shared ""family style"".  I'm still talking about the roasted brussels sprouts.  I will definitely be a reoccurring patron. I will point out that the Seafood Pasta is very spicy.",4
"Well I had free tix with a drink purchase still cost me $26 for two people. The Drinks were terrible by the way. The show was ok had crying kids in the crowd the show could be seen by kids and thats what I would call it a rated G show. My wife thought it was cute I thought it was a waste of time personally.  He had a couple good jokes, his invisible cloak act was dumb. And although there was plenty of seats they sat us in the rear facing other guests :(",2
my review is for greyhound as a business.. i travel a couple times a month and more times than not the bus is over an hour late to arrive.  my bus should have left at 345am and its 456am.. unacceptable.. and the wifi never works.. dont advertise that you offer wifi when it never works.. your buses are old as s**t and the plug outlets dont work,1
"Had the terra y mar (surf & turf) it was delicious. I split it with my husband and we couldn't finish it all. They had live music, which we enjoyed.",5
"Still hosting our Notre Dame watch parties. Love the venue, also good food, but the service continues to be an issue. Last night was awful! Server disappears forever, can't get drinks .... got the wrong checks .... some servers are so GOOD while others are absent. Such a shame, and so frustrating. I got up 4 times and went looking for our server for a drink, and then to order dinner, and again to get the wrong check, and again to get the right check. Come on guys! You can do better than this.",2
"This place gives me hope for more places like it.  Its not in ""Charlotte"", but Fort Mill is a stones throw away and it's super easy to get to without any traffic.  Definitely worth venturing out of the city limits to experience some authentic Chinese dishes.  The do have the americanized dishes on their menu too if that is what you fancy, but it is definitely great to have the options.

All the yelp photos helped us tremendously as well as our server, whom patiently recommended dishes once we bombarded her with questions.

We over-ordered of course, but that means we had leftovers available for later (and we got to try a lot of things in one sitting).  The szchenuan wontons were amazing... (hopefully you are a fan of spicy since this place does have a lot of options with all things pepper on them).  The twice cooked pork was awesome as well.  Make sure to ask your server about their season items like the veggies and their specials!

Overall, it was located in a strip mall but had a ton of tables... seemed like there were a lot of people and some reserved booths for the regulars.  The space had either just been remodeled and kept neat and tidy.... almost a 50's soda shop type feel inside.  Regardless of the decor, the food definitely was the star... and I had to almost roll myself out the door like Violet Beauregard in the chocolate factory.",4
"Nice and affordable Mediterranean food hidden in a strip mall.  This mom and pop shop offers service with a smile and were very pleasent.  We had the lamb over rice and chicken schwarma, which tasted great. The rice was lightly seasoned and complimented the protein well. Love supporting local establishments and will return.",5
"Food and service are great.  Wide variety of pizza, salads, and pasta.  My favorite pizza is Fran's Favorite.  The wings are great too.  I also recommend the Greek salad.  It's a little on the pricey side, a few drinks and a  pizza  will run you about $40 for two.  But I do love the great food, ambiance and friendly service.",4
"Breakfast, breakfast, breakfast!!!  I've been here many times over the years 90% of which I've ordered breakfast.  Diner breakfast easily excites me and this place hits the spot!!  Home fries over hash browns and if my bacon bends and not breaks, then you can get  from me!  I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here.  I love it here any time of day from early a.m. when the seniors are here to after hours when the drunks are here lol. Thanks for many delicious meals, Ritters, and hopefully more to come :)",5
We love it!!! Especially my Son. There location on Baseline Road in Mesa is awesome as well.,5
"Betty's is just fine for what it is: a dive bar and local watering hole. Their beer selection is pretty great. The food is totally mediocre. I tried the steak and Guinness pie last night, which was pretty bland, but did the job. Their nachos are run-of-the-mill. I've been turned off from ordering the burger since a friend of mine once did and found not one but two hairs in it--bit of a deterrent! 

My softball team used to go here after games sometimes, and in that respect it's totally fine. Group beers yay, dinner nay.",3
"Not worth the time or money. Drinks are overpriced and weaker than a 12 year old boy. Edamame was microwaved. The sushi was ok- bland, nothing tasted fresh and it seemed the more expensive the roll the thinner the slices were(barely a 1/4"" wide).  TJ hibachi in great northern mall or Ginza downtown puts this place to shame. Glad I had a groupon for Tomo- would've been even more disappointed to pay full price. Maybe their hibachi is better but I would never go back for sushi.",1
"I used to come here all the time because:
-they have tons of color choices
-there plenty of technicians so there's almost always an opening
-the prices are pretty good 
-it's clean

Today my experience was less than satisfying.
-the front desk girl had no idea what she was doing
-my nail technician was rude, rough, and made me bleed multiple times after I asked her nicely to be careful
-my manicure was rushed and even after being asked to round them out, my nails turned out uneven shapes

I don't normally leave negative reviews, and I used to love this place, but I am glad I found a new nail salon after my experience today.",2
"We have ordered and enjoyed: buffalo chicken salad, steak salad, Caesar salad, tossed salad with cheese, spinach rolls, eggplant parmesan hoagie, the Napoleon pizza, and pizza with and without toppings. As others have mentioned, the cheesey breadsticks are great. I'm vegetarian and I love their eggplant parm, especially on the Napoleon pizza. 

We get delivery in Fineview in 45 minutes or less. I've ordered online, through Eat24 and GrubHub. I prefer Eat24 and their weekly $2 coupon, as well as their Pizza & Sticks deal for $16.99 (large cheese pizza, breadsticks & mozzarella sticks [toppings extra].)

I believe the horrible driver people have mentioned no longer works there. We've been ordering delivery on monthly basis from Riviera Pizza for over two years and have had a problem only once.",4
My all time favorite sushi spot in AZ. Reasonably priced and super tasty! I absolutely love the salmon nigiri and matrix roll.,5
"Riddle Room is easily my favourite board game cafe in Toronto. They have a wall full of board games and the staff there are really engaging and teach you through them. It's relatively cheap as they only require you to purchase a drink and you can stay however long you like. They also have video console games!

I've tried one of their escape rooms before, and the experience was definitely worth the price I paid.  I believe there are 5 in total and I will have to come back and try them all.",5
"My kids declared this place ""the best restaurant in Toronto."" It's in a fun location and the food is terrific--a lot of variety so everyone in the family can find something they like. (I strongly recommend the jerk chicken salad!) The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We just sorry we won't be able to eat here again until our next visit to Toronto.",5
Amazing staff!!! So friendly and accommodating! Food and drinks are to DIE for!! Will definitely be back again and again!,5
Was known as Amelio's. Business has closed his door for a few time and reopened,2
"I scheduled a move for my grandmother through BlueBox moving. I was out of state so I was worried but very quickly I felt confident. She's an elderly woman and the BB team was so helpful and communicated through each step of the way. I paid to have the guys pack up her apartment and clean and move her into her retirement home. They cleaned up and I got a full deposit back from her apartment and they made her feel SOO comfortable. 

I would recommend them to anyone out there that is moving. Highly recommended for elderly customers. They're honest and reliable!",5
"If you're looking for a damn good breakfast in Montréal, you've found it!

The highlight of the meal, for me, has been the potatoes cooked with onions.  They were a pleasant surprise the first time I had them.  I'm used to your average ""diner home fries"" that aren't ever anything to write home about.  But these are clearly fresh cut potatoes, cooked to order.  

But the absolute STAR of the show is the fresh squeezed orange juice!  The large is around $6, but worth every penny.  I've yet to find a better glass of OJ anywhere.

On weekend mornings you'll usually have a pretty decent sized line out the door.  It goes without saying that if that's the case during the winter, you best not forget your hat. But grab yourself a Mirror off the rack or chat up some of your hungry line mates.

The service is usually very friendly and willing to joke & chat while taking your order... I've only had one instance where we had a moody waitress, but she wasn't rude, so I assumed it was just a bad day.  We've all had them.

Eggspectations is definitely my place for breakfast whenever I visit Montréal.",5
"This is my boyfriend's review since it's his favorite place.

I just love the carne asade burritos, that's what you come here for. I mean the enchillads are ok and the tacos are nice but it's all about coming here after work and grabbing a big burrito. Plus i used to come here after going to clubs and what not since it's open 24/7",4
"A true hidden gem next to and upstairs from the SF supermarket. Since there are only a few vegetarian restaurants in Vegas, a good Asian one is a definite welcome addition. It gives you have options for dining out, especially if there is a vegetarian or Buddhist in your party

I was only able to try a few dishes since I was dining solo. I ordered the roti appetizer, pot stickers, and stir fired tofu with vegetable. In addition to traditional vegetarian dishes (stir fried vegies, tofu,etc.) There is a very large selection of faux meat dishes. 

The roti appetizer was terrific, some of the best roti I have had in Vegas. Very flaky and not too greasy. The pot stickers were also very good, having minced tofu and leek, I think. You couldn't tell it was vegetarian since it tasted great. The last dish I ordered was a stir fried tofu dish with vegetables which was fine, nothing special. Brown rice is an option, but they do charge extra for it as well as charging for extra orders of white rice.

Service was friendly and attentive, nothing fantastic, but definitely nothing negative. And the food was prepared and served quickly. Definitely worth a return visit.

.",4
"Very cool restaurant. It has a super chill vibe to it. They encourage you to write on the walls near the bathroom, which are very clean so that's a huge plus!

They also have a great rewards program you use with your phone number. You earn stars for each entree and for every 7 stars you earn you get $10 off your bill.

I believe I came in on a soft opening and they had a simple menu which I appreciated.

I had the pho king pho bo and bang bang sliders.
The pho was interesting in a good way.It had a different flavor than the norm viet pho. I believe it's advertised as having a Thai twist. The noodles were really good and so we're the meatballs. The one thing I did not enjoy was the meat in it. It was pretty chewy.

Bang bang sliders were good! The value was also great -3 pretty big sliders for $8. The meat was really tender and I like the buns.

Also try the ube ice cream! I enjoyed how the owner gives out free samples for people to try it!",4
"The food was not that good; I ordered the Chicken Fajitas and chicken was dry, re-fried beans were yuk (canned re-fried beans would have been tastier). Service was okay but our drinks went dry twice before anyone came over to refill. 

Great atmosphere if you have an opportunity to sit out on the patio overlooking the strip. Order the Chips & Salsa and a drink and that would be the best experience of this place.",2
"I printed a FREE First Time Client Exams voucher offered during a TV advertisement.
Tried to schedule appointment for 3 days, no answer, only invitation to leave a message. 
I  kept calling. Finally I scheduled appointment for today, July 17 at 2:30 pm. 
My dog and I arrived at the hospital approximately 10 minutes earlier. We waited few minutes to check in, I filled out some information about the dog, than waited few more minutes to be sited in the exam room to see the doctor. 50 minutes passed, I went outside and reminded the front desk lady that we are waiting for about 50 minutes. She apologized and said that the doctor will be with us in a moment.
At 3:30pm I left the room with my dog and said that I cannot wait more. One hour+, I think this was enough waist of my time. I am not going back to this place. It wasn't very friendly or clean. My dog needed vaccination and dental check. The doctor didn't see my dog, we were forgotten in the exam room and now I am glad that I just waisted my time, and not jeopardize my dog's health... Imagine he could been left alone after medical procedure. I hope this happened by accident, not because I had Free ""First Time Client Exam"" and they will not make money from this exam.",1
"We just about always order online, for me it is easier, especially when I'm traveling and want to place a future order to pick up. Staff is always helpful and courteous. Great location for our home in Vermillion. Keep up the great service!",5
"We tried the $180 menu, which includes amuse bouche, appetizer, soup, entree, and dessert.  The amazing bread cart and petit fours cart is also included.  I started with the scallop carpaccio, pea soup, duck and foie gras entree, and the chocolate sherbet for dessert.  In a word, it was ethereal.  The presentation of each dish is a work of art.  It seemed as if every miniscule flower on the scallop carpaccio was intricately placed, and every drizzle was deliberate.  The service is terrific and not stuffy.  The dining room is plush and very quiet but comfortable.  The bread cart and petit four cart were definitely highlights of the experience.  Both are mind-blowingly beautiful and the selections are vast.  Kudos to the waiter for being able to rattle off the long list of breads and chocolates.
Robuchon offers a very special and unique dining experience.",5
"I'm a fan of party city! They have a really good selection when it comes to decorations, balloons, and things you never knew you needed. You can end up spending a lot more money than anticipated if you're not careful, (It's kind of like a Target thing in that regard). If you have a budget, I would recommend writing out a list and sticking to it or else you could easily go overboard. 
It's much more expensive than a place such as Walmart, but for good reason; you won't find things in Walmart that you can find here. 
A side note: They have gender-reveal streamers and balloons if you're hosting a gender-reveal party! There is no warranty on the gender confetti balloon, so be careful taking it to the car and handling it (no pressure). 
Overall, the customers are helpful and friendly at this location.",4
"Since Top Chef is one of my all time favorite shows I was excited that one of the cheftestants would be opening up a restaurant in vegas! I have been there two times now, once for happy hour and once for dinner. 

My friends and I tried all the appetizers on the happy hour menu, since they are all only $5. I would recommend all of them (the watermelon  and goat cheese salad, crispy pork dumpling, oyster mushrooms and peppered chicken), the only one I wouldn't order again was the curried dumplings. They give you a pretty good portion for $5 so definitely hit up the happy hour. Also, they had $5 wine and cocktails.

When I went for dinner we ordered the crab toast with mango mustard and the pork belly tacos. Both of the entrees were very tasty. Our server recommended the crab toast and said it was one of this favorites, I liked it but I am not sure I would get it again -  I can't put my finger on why, but it just wasn't my favorite. The pork belly tacos on the other hand were awesome. The taco shell is actually the sweet, white, asian bread that you can get at dim sum and then inside is the pork belly. I thought there was a little too much bread for how much pork belly, but overall the favors were delicious. Then for desert we got the watermelon and goat cheese salad (my fav).

I can't wait to go back and try some more!",4
"I visit the Concord Mills area often on business and have eaten at this Red Lobster location on multiple occasions. The food is usually fresh and good, but my issue is that that at 5:45pm, they can't seat guests because servers are not scheduled in to work. The restaurant had more than 50 percent of tables open, but I had to wait 15 minutes for a table/server. This has happened before, but no more. Today was my last visit.",2
"I take my dogs for many years and have gotten great services.
It is hard to get an appt. because they are very busy,
They are the only vet that has not tried to rip me off.",5
i love this place i get my hair done here and my mom does to nadia the shop owner is the greatest she is the only person i let touch my hair  i really like this place and recommend it . :),5
The Brussel Sprouts and Oxtail were very good. The wait staff was efficient and knowledgeable. The brazino was very salty,4
"For some reason I thought I had already reviewed this place and after my recent experience I needed to update my review.  Well, it turns out I did not actually review it the first time.  I've decided to use phrases that I heard constantly on my report cards as I was growing up.

My original visit was not so great.  The service was really blah and despite us ordering a shit ton of alcohol (I know, I know, a common theme in my reviews, I swear I don't have a problem), the server was not at all attentive.  Overall, I could sum up my original experience as a report card: Fails to reach it's full potential.

Cue up my most recent visit which took place at 4.15pm on a Thursday under the advice of my friend who said I would LOVE the deals.  (I really really like a deal!)  

Pizza - $5
Wine - $5

The pizza was freakin' amazing and the WINE WAS $5!  Report card review: Solid improvement.  

Now, I have a problem.  The pizza was so amazing that I can't stop thinking about it.  I almost stopped there today by myself and paid full price to drink wine and eat pizza on my own.  Report card review on my obvious pizza/wine issues: Heather tends to focus on one thing to the exclusion of getting her work done.  

Bottom line - Give them a try during Happy Hour (M-F, 3-5pm) where pizzas are $5 and WINE IS $5.  If you like it, perhaps I'll see you there soon as we both order pizza and wine by ourselves.",4
"Been going here for years, the pizza got a little mediocre at one point, and I heard from an insider due to a family issue etc etc. they had let ""THE"" pizza guy go and had peeps with no skills creating the pie's, it showed. Glad to say it's better again, not sure what they did, but its been good. I'm a transplanted NY'er and know my pizza, and they do a rocking basic NY pie, the sicilian is great, for a little over $20 me and my wife get 4 meals out of that thing, a full large pizza box full of goodness! The calzones are also very good and salads are worth the money. The only current bad is the delivery, for a while I just didn't call them, always an 1.5 hour wait, that's just unacceptable. It's been better as of late and will continue to do business with them",3
"I needed my holding tanks serviced while I was in Vegas last December and Daisy Fresh had some good reviews so I called and set up an appointment. Robert is a very likable man no doubt! What I didn't like was paying before he told me that he didn't have the equipment needed to clean my gray tanks!  So after the $ I spent with Daisy Fresh, I still had to find someone that could hydro-flush my gray tanks using the most modern methods of going up through the drain tubes. He flushed my black tank by going through the toliet, and after he did this I had problems with my toilet seal leaking.  Because of this I cannot recommend his services.",1
The curry dishes were quite good for the price.  I had the mango curry with tofu.  Good size portion and I had some to take home.  Only wish brown rice was an option.,3
"I was originally blown away by the Trump, but then I went back... This time I had a studio, nice and all, but some details really bothered me.  Our room neighbors had lunch in their room and left their tray around 3pm... the tray was still laying in the hallway when we came back at midnight!!

One of our pillow cover had a gigantic pink stain, and the other had a big hole.

The toilet paper is as good as you expect... from an airport maybe?

The shower was clogged and draining.

Anyway, still a great hotel, just not as perfect as I originally thought.",4
"What can I say? I pink puffy heart love I Love Sushi. We moved across town and it has been our favorite find. It's a real gem. The staff is great (bar and table service), the fish is fresh and the rolls are fun and mighty tasty. In the past few months we've been half a dozen times. 

When it comes to rolls we prefer those that are spicy. Sexy Time Special, Kiss of Fire and Sun Devil are favorites. They are a must each and every time. We also enjoy the sashimi. The yellowtail is like butter. The screaming orgasm is a great alternative. We've enjoyed others, but their names escape me. Each and everyone is delicious, though. I have no doubt everything is well executed. So thankful, it's not AYCE. I much prefer quality to quantity.",5
"Food is okay, service isn't so great. I ordered a 5 course meal and left still hungry.  In addition, my bill was $105 total and still hungry.  Waitress forgot about me so after waiting nearly an hour to pay, I had to walk my money up to the kitchen door to finish paying/transaction.  Waffle House service at a premium price.",1
Great happy hour specials. 75 kinds of rum. 15 bucks for a meal and a drink. Staff was friendly and came over more than enough. Corn salsa was my favorite. I sat at the bar. Will return.,4
"The chicken tikka masala meal is pretty good but the entire paper bag from the restaurant (especially the naan) smelled heavily of cigarette smoke.  The naan was completely inedible due to the cigarette smell/taste - it was really disgusting especially in terms of taste...  Even though the taste of one dish from the restaurant is good, the cigarette smoke smell/taste that has transferred to the food is just unforgivable.",2
"Just a bright little window ledge with a few seats, a counter where you order, and a few shelves of vietnamese snacks and dried soups, some fridges with prepared foods. The best Bahn Mi in the area, and there are some good ones. The chicken curry noodle soup is nice too especially on a rainy day. The service is friendly and smiling and things are made fresh for the most part. A great spot to grab a sandwich before a picnic in the park.",4
"The best I can say about this place is average. Nothing outstanding came through the meal. I had the enchiladas verdes. The chicken was under seasoned and made for an average enchilada. The plate came with rice and salad. Beans were ""extra"" which was irritating and tasted canned. Plenty of other better Mexican restaurants in the area.  Service was good. I wanted to really like the place based on its ratings, but it isn't that memorable.",2
"I can't even begin to describe to you the deliciousness that is La Paloma ice cream.  I first went to the Woodbridge location when I still ate dairy and happily tasted any and all of flavours I could.  

Now that I am vegan I still go out of my way to hit the St. Clair location for their soy ice cream.  It is so creamy you'll think that you are being fooled.  It tastes unlike any soy ice cream I have ever tasted - and they make it themselves.  

I promise you that if you try this ice cream, soy or dairy-based, you will not be disappointed.  It might be the best ice cream you've ever had.",5
Save your money and time and eat somewhere else cause this is not what it is cracked out to be. The only thing I enjoyed here was the shrimp taco. Salsa was a joke how do you make salsa with no flavor?? Who does that?? myself and my friend whom flew in from Kansas took one bite of everything and both had a look of sadness from this meal. Sorry Pink Taco you will never see me again.,1
"Every time I pass by this place, there was always a long line and people would rave about it from co workers to management staff at my apt building to uber drivers! 

But I have mixed reviews about this place after I tried their fish tacos and BBQ mahi. Really overpriced for the lack of quality. The tacos were mediocre- fish tacos tasted bland and the batter overpowered the fish inside. The BBQ sauce on the Mahi tasted like it came from a bottle that you can buy from the store and fish was overcooked.

Will prob go back here again only because our server was so pleasant and accommodating. She noticed I didn't like the beer she suggested so she offered me what i originally wanted on the house. They clean the tables right away and try to seat ppl as fast as they can.",3
"While the food was good here, the service left some to be desired.  Considering the price, I would have expected excellent food and service.

I tried the lobster spoons, which were outstanding.  The tenderloin steak was also quite nice, although it took them some time and a reminder to bring out the sauce.  The sides of frites, onion frites and mushrooms were quite nice - particularly the onion frites (like onion rings except much more tasty).  

Overall, the food was quite good, but perhaps significantly overpriced.  The service was fairly slow.  Our main waiter was friendly and helpful, but the serving staff that was sent out to provide the food didn't quite know what to do.  Unfortunately, I feel this place is more about the show than the good restaurant.",3
"Dayum you Gabi! I had it my mind (fuzzy as it has been since Sunday) to be the FTR on this event. Well. Who cares! What a fabulous day. It was like seeing family. I saw industry folk, lots of yelpers and so many of my customers and neighbors from the CenPho hood!

Corn Dogs from District! Seriously. I could eat those babies for breakfast. 
Gelato from Chelsea's Kitchen!? Seriously I could eat that for breakfast!
Sea Scallops with pea risotto from A Different Pointe of View. Yep. Breakfast. Eggs over easy. Done deal.
And the wine! The tequila. And the Dragonberry Rum. Yep. Hair of the dog. Breakfast all the way.

PAM has never looked prettier to me. And by the end of the day. Everyone I saw had never looked prettier to me. Recall the wine, tequila and rum!

Great event. GO PHOENIX FOODIES!

Five stars. Great double date with Rickie, Anton and Dave. 

The only bad things was the neon green drink band clashed with my black and pink Hello Kitty bracelet.

Hmmm...",5
"I was surprised that I hadn't written a review for this place.  I've been here at least a dozen times in the last year or so.

It's a great place, friendly staff, easy parking, convenient location, free refills on sodas.  I've really only had the Barry B which is a turkey/swiss/bacon sandwich because I ordered it the first time I came in and never changed.  

Their menu selection is just huge with lots of unique sandwiches.  Get the Dutch crunch bread with the crunchy, buttery top.  I think it's probably the best sandwich bread I've ever had.  Expect to pay about $10-$15 for a sandwich, chips and a drink.

Forgot to add:  I went in recently for their breakfast sandwiches.  Try The Hangover.  Eggs, your choice of meat, cheese, tater tots, and a really spicy hot sauce.",4
"You can say a lot of things about this place, but most will agree, this isn't like having a cocktail at the Ritz. 

Grandma's old couch at the front, with a large patio at the back, there's a plenty of good seats for everyone. 

The bar is well stocked and beers come fast. We were on a whiskey tour that night, but balanced it out with a few local beers on tap. There's a filthy fooseball table in the back too if you want to play a round of jitz! 

Pro tip#1613: Bring cash. They don't take plastic. Luckily, there's a Scotiabank at the 7 eleven just around the corner.",3
I am a current tenant at a property managed by McKenna Property Management. In the 4 months I've lived here they have provided nothing but outstanding service with anything we've needed. They've very prompt and efficient with service calls and gentlemen they sent out to fix carpet and the gate was extremely professional and friendly. I recommend anyone to rent under this management company.,5
