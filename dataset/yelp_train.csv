In general very good buffet for the price..nice little sushi bar ..crab legs and such. I highly recommend if u like Chinese  buffet ..,5
We sat at the bar as we usually do and ordered a couple of drinks and some appetizers. Our bartender was the worst terrible service and just a bad vibe. We over heard him arguing with a female coworker. It wasn't really busy.. I think he was just having a bad day or is just a jerk. Either way he ruined our experience..,1
Great Thai food! hole in the wall style location.  Very friendly staff. Let Sabi make your favorite and you will be impressed.,5
"I am giving it 4 stars just because it's vegan, but it really only deserves 3 stars. The quality of the food is great, but the flavours are just a little off. We've been twice now, tried different dishes, and every time everyone at the table is slightly disappointed by the flavours. The dishes are so close to being delicious, yet so far. I will return on invite, but won't be suggesting it as a go to spot.",4
This was the first Pho place I ever tried in Vegas. I absolutely love the Shrimp Pho. I was actually sick for a few days and after eating this 2-3days in a row.. I was feeling much better. Only thing is the places gets packed so its hard to place a to go order. Online ordering would make this so much easier but even the wait and chaos IS WORTH IT!!,4
It is so awesome! We really love it! Definitely a super fun summer activity! Can't wait to come back again! We love extreme air!!,5
"I have had Baguette Cafe bookmarked to try for a while and finally stopped by on my lunch break to try out a sandwich. Baguette Cafe is a bit hard to find the first time. I had trouble locating it since it is nestled with other office buildings, but had the address thanks to yelp and soon found my way. I was impressed with how many tables and chairs there is outside. It was a glorious day out too and many people were eating out there.

When it came time for my order, Olivier, one of the owners was glad to go over the different sandwiches with me. I ordered ""The Prosciutto"" priced at $6.95 and it came on a baguette. The sandwich had prosciutto, salami, mixed greens, tomato, walnuts, celery and blue cheese spread. The sandwich had a good taste, but the bread was tough to chew and rough on my gums. I have been told by other yelpers that getting the sandwich ""panini"" style isn't so rough on your jaw/mouth, but wanted to try it how it came on the baguette the first time. I also didn't taste any celery and only tasted one bite of blue cheese and felt the sandwich could have had more meat in it to match the rough texture of the bread, but did I did think what was in-between the bread tasted good.  I also kindly asked him if he would do the honor of choosing a dessert for me to have later. The reason I asked him to chose for me is because I would have went with the same ole thing and I'm sure that would have tasted great, but I wanted to try something different. Sure enough, what Olivier picked out was nothing I would have picked on my own and now after having it, I was left craving more.

Should you want to cater breakfast or lunch for your office, Baguette Cafe can handle that for you. With the right amount of notice they can deliver and set up the food so call and ask for details. 

If you are feeling like an omelet, sandwich, wrap, soup, salad, fresh juice or even a latte, they have that too.",3
"We have visited Heart and Soul Cafe a few times in the past 6 months. They are consistent on good service and good food. The place is clean. We have had salad, sandwich, and pizza.
The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable.
This is a spot we pop in when out running errands and need a bite.",4
"Frozen cosmos with a shot of chambord = AWESOME.  Priced for Happy Hour (4:30-6:30) at $3.50 is hard to beat.

Mac and cheese is excellent, as is the lasagne aubergine.  The service wasn't noticeably bad, so I have no complaints there.  

I take all my out-of-town guests there.",4
"This has to be the best restaurant, Thai or other, that is in Squirrel Hill. The dishes all display their unique taste traits while coming together perfectly. I'm addicted to mango tango and the fresh rolls. They actually make the dish Thai spicy if you ask for it, not just American spicy.
What's wonderful about this place is that the it's not just about delicious food. The owner and staff are extraordinarily kind and go out of their way to make your dining experience enjoyable. 
Please eat here and don't miss out on an incredible meal with kind people.",5
"First things first: Amanda was an exceptional server. Very funny and engaging, she made us feel welcome immediately. 
For this reason alone, I will be back. I haven't ordered yet, and will continue this review after I eat :)

Annnd, I ate. It was really yummy. I had the country benny and at first I was thinking ""theres no way ill finish this.."" 
Fast forward about 5 mins, im looking down at a completely clean plate....yep. Im not ashamed. Youll probably do the same thing.",5
"5 stars just for the Iced Tea!!! It wasn't your average passion fruit, it was something better; even garnished with an orange. The service was on the brink of ""too good"" and the food was excellent.

We sat at the bar to watch the Illinois Basketball game; they have about 3-4 TVs to watch sports. There is also plenty of seating.

For appetizers, we ordered the cheese curds, pretzel, and lamb meatballs. The cheese curds were amazing, basically just fried cheese with marinara sauce. The pretzel was also good - a little burnt in places but nothing too aggravating. It came with nacho cheese and mustard. Our server had the chef chop it up into bite size so we could share easily. Very thoughtful. 

For my lunch entree, I ordered the Dijon chicken. It came with two asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes with sausage chopped up in it. for about $10, i would order this over and over again. It truly felt like a hearty, but healthy lunch option, especially relative to other options on the menu. The price cannot be beat.",5
"What a foolish excuse; it's run more like a carnival than a business. 
I've gone their for years. Today I couldn't communicate to the detailers to roll my windows down a bit to wipe the window edges. I walked up to the manager, ""Dustin,"" with my five dollar tip in my hand and said, ""I'd love to tip someone if I could get them to wipe off my window edges.""
Dustin first let me know that, ""hey, they don't speak English, so what do you want?"" (with a grin and a dismissive shrug). 
Then he let me know that it was against owner's policy  and that he would lose his job if he had the window edges wiped. I said I thought that was ridiculous. 
THEN he said if ""you want the window edges wiped that's a two dollar charge.  You have to pay two dollars for that.""  This was silly, especially because I'm standing there holding a $5 bill I'm trying to give someone. 
At that point the little guy was up in my face and was very confrontational. So I said that I know BS when I hear it, and the verbal exchange went downhill from there. 
Needless to say, I didn't get my window edges wiped and the staff didn't get a tip. 
I just think its odd that a so-called ""business"" owner would encourage his staff to be so obnoxious over trivial stuff; but from the other comments it sounds like the owner is an incredible jerk and that certainly is communicated by his staff. 
The other revolting attitude was the racist contempt Dustin and his assistants have for the Hispanic detailers; that really came through loud and clear. 
We have this gigantic immigration problem caused by business owners hiring illegals. Then, rather than being grateful for inexpensive, hardworking help they cultivate this abusive attitude toward them. These superior and arrogant white guys are shameful and disgusting in their attitudes. 
Don't waste your time and money on this bunch of racist carnies. They are as nasty to their staff as they will be to you.",1
"The staff here is wonderful. Every time I go Steve the master sushi chef always shows great hospitality. He'll even make some special dishes just for fun. The fish is fresh and the rolls are made tight and right. The environment is very nice,modern, and open.  Wednesdays and Thursdays they have $4 martinis and they are delish. Ask for the fantasy roll, it's not on the menu. The reason I give it four out of five is because there is no AYCE,otherwise it's a great spot all around.",4
"Local, fresh, funky with a great peaceful vibe from everyone, employee and patio ""friends"" you make included...",5
Kids love going here. From my 19 yr old down to my 8yr old god son. This place is fun and affordable. Great place for anyone to be physically active versus sports or gyms that come with a monthly membership. #familyfun,5
"I give this place 2 stars because it was incredibly average. I loved the ambiance, the attentiveness from the staff, the cleanliness. All those things were great. But when it comes down to it, I just want a good wax. The gal who did mine was super friendly, very nice. But again, I just want it done right. She had missed a few hairs, so I had to go home and shave. I also got a brow waxing and the shape is exactly what I came in with. I even advised the front desk when I set the appt, that it was important I have someone who can shape brows. I'm not saying I wouldn't go back, I'm just saying it wasn't a great wax. Everything else was awesome.",2
"Of course it's Saturday and after 2 pm and I call the store and they tell me expect a MINIMUM 2 HOUR WAIT, which I'm good with. It's 109 degrees in the shade and having worked in this heat for 30 years understand by the end of the day it's drained you.
Patrick who took the call what great to talk to as well as Justin at the counter who took able to handle what I needed done to my vehicle.
I've used Discount Tire for years and will continue to.",5
Just tried this place for the first time today since we just moved offices downtown and I was blown away! Incredible burrito and extremely friendly staff. I've never been to a burrito spot that can make it as specifically spicy as I like it and they nailed it. Nothing bland about the food here.. create whatever you want and as spicy as you like. Great experience and will most definitely be back.,5
"My husband and I were really in the mood for a good burger & we were so disappointed. We ordered the Green Chile French Fries and the Green Chile's were cold on the plate. We told the waitress we were splitting a burger (we built our own) & when I received mine there was very little meat on it. Biggest mistake don't tell them your splitting it, because the gentleman next to me his burger was Huge! Not worth the money.",2
"I have been to Thailand before and I find the food here to be quite good.  It is really nice that Fountain Hills finally has a Thai restaurant; it was badly needed.  The place is small and can get crowded, especially at lunch time.  I prefer lunch here, as the prices are better.  The spices taste authentic and it is nice you can get the level of heat you want (1 for mild; 5 for hot).  The 5 isn't terribly hot, so if you like Thai food even a bit spicy, I would tend towards 4 or 5.  The Drunken Noodles were very good, but the other dishes I tried were good too.",5
The service department has had my van numerous times for the same problem. Then I asked about trading the vehicle in and they offered me way less than my vehicle is worth and actually added 800$ to the sticker price of their vehicle. Seemed crazy but that was there offer. I would not recommend this facility.,1
"This place is just flat out delicious. I mean, flavor explosion to the head, shhhh-I'm-eating, how do they do it kind of delicious. They don't have a liquor license, which is odd - you have to be a local to know to bring some wine. I didn't know... But it's ok: all my cash went to the chef, and I feel he deserves it. Bravo.",5
"2/5 stars, a blatant waste of money. Where do I start. Let's get the good things out of the way first. The decoration is appealing and the service is ok. If only the same could be said about the food.  The portions were very small for the amount paid. Almost 6bucks for a fistful of tempura fish cakes that weren't evenly seasoned. Some pieces were much saltier than the others (at one point it felt like I ate a spoonful of salt).10 bucks for a fried chicken bento that comes with rice, UNseasoned broccoli, half a cutlet of chicken, HALF an egg and HALF a meatball. I get that meat could be expensive but half a meatball?! Half an egg?! I also ordered Tainan braised pork rice and my oh my. The pork was less than a fistful and was very dry (tasted like it was microwaved) and there was no gravy or sauce to add moisture to the meal. It was overall unsatisfying. I was really excited for this place to open at first because I really like Taiwanese style street snacks. But after giving this place a try twice, I would say that I am utterly disappointed.",2
"I don't get it.

I thought I would love it, because many of the restaurants I enjoy most are built upon a philosophy of local, sustainable, and seasonal ingredients which are treated with the respect and care they deserve. All the recommendations I've had from my Cleveland friends told me that The Greenhouse was such a place, and one that rated visiting on one of my too-rare stops in Cleveland. Yet the experience was - and this is the only word to describe it - bizarre. 

Their rendition of a Cleveland standard, stuffed bacon-wrapped dates, was stellar, but from there the meal descended into chaos.  Was the Greenhouse was going for the 'greenest' of cuisine, minimalist dishes where the ingredients saw as little preparation as possible, or more of a stylized, structured 'haute' cuisine? We couldn't tell, and neither really worked. The appetizer of roasted peppers with smashed garlic was an example of the former - the two main ingredients were simply treated and mixed upon the plate, the garlic somewhat in and out of its paper, which stuck to the moist pepper skin, making for a ridiculous looking plate and an unpleasant eating experience.   The 'Mushroom Bear Claw' - a cinnamon bun like roll of mushrooms in puff pastry -- arrived looking stunning amidst the rich miso broth it sat upon. While the pastry was good and the stuffing tasty, the miso was both so acidic and so salty that it ruined the dish by overpowering the delicacy of the woodear mushroom filling.  A main course of white bean polenta, Lee Jones vegetables, and tofu occupied the opposite end of the spectrum - that food had been tortured into a structured submission by the chef:  the excellent seasonal vegetables had been tourned (properly, I should note), and placed next to tofu and a perfectly square polenta cake. The highly stylized dish was an odd followup to the minimalist pepper appetizer - and why, if you are showing off the quality of your ingredients, touting Chef's Garden as a supplier, would you tourne them?  The dish might have been fine were it not for the brine that the elements sat in. My date tried to eat just the top of the excellent polenta as that which had soaked up the extremely salty broth was inedible.  My entrée, the Duck Pasta, was supposed to be duck livers and craklins, roasted red onion, and local apples with a cavatelli-like pasta and toasted bread crumbs. The pasta arrived limp and overcooked, with none of the other ingredients discernable - supposedly they must have been the spaetzele-like brown crumbs that coated the pasta. Or was that the breadcrumbs? Or were they ground into the sauce on the pasta? We had no idea.  It seemed to be another rather stylized dish that might have been just sub par were it not for - again - an incredible amount of salt that rendered it truly unpleasant.. Unlike my date's main course, this could not be salvaged by selectively eating parts. After my date agreed, we asked for the check.

Good points: Our server had an excellent (albeit slightly overzealous) knowledge of beer, and recommended to my date a selection that she really enjoyed. They also handled our dissatisfaction well, by removing some items from the bill and offering free desserts (which we declined, as we wanted to leave and find something else to eat).

If I lived in Cleveland, I would go back again as our experience defies everything I have ever heard about the Greenhouse, but as a visitor who loves Cleveland's culinary scene, I'll be looking to other restaurants when I next return.",1
"I had the pleasure of being on this side of town and I wanted to get something to munch on.  Alas, saw this shop on Hot and New, so gave it a shot and the rest is history.

From the outside, it looks like your normal donut shot, but from the inside, it is very, very different.  I noticed the bamboo-like counter and stainless steel first.  It's not your typical set up for donuts.  Inside, the ceilings are high and the decor is very modern, yet minimalistic.  The floors are concrete, which adds as nice touch.

The donuts here are what I came here for, so lets get started.  First off, my eyes were immediately drawn the the cereal topped donuts.  I saw fruity pebbles, captain crunch, cocoa puffs, fruit loops, lucky charms, cinnamon toast crunch, and from the looks of it, this is genius, mixing breakfast cereals with donuts.  A win-win situation.  I had the fruity pebbles donut and it was delicious.  The donut itself wasn't sweet at all and what I noticed about all the raised donuts is that they are considerable raised higher than other donut shops.  This can only mean they use quality ingredients in their donuts.

I also appreciate the fact that the owner was able to help me decide on what donuts to get and didn't rush me.  They also have apple fritters that I will hopefully try next time and an array of other donut classics and some that are a twist to your typical fare.  There is much more planned for this donut shop and I can't wait to see what happens.  

They also have smoothies, coffee, and croissants.  This shop just opened as well, and wishing them a lot of success in the future.  By the way, it's right next to Kyoto Bowl.",5
"This place is OK. I like the choice of dipping sauces and sides over a simple menu at other chicken places. Customer service could improve. Also, the decor inside makes me look over my shoulder waiting for Tammy to walk in.",3
"After a ton of rave reviews from close friends, I stopped by this summer and I'm hooked. I love the taro drinks with fresh taro- the flavor is perfect. It's not super close to me but if I'm in the area, I make a point to stop because their drinks are so good. The service is great and even when it's crowded, the drinks come out really fast!",5
"Visited this KFC on August 18, 2015. I must have bad luck when I go there. This time I was missing an item from my order. Disappointed needless to say. The question is does management really care.",2
"Service was awesome!  Gabriela greeted us, but Carmen was our server and she was very knowledgeable of the menu and recommended the Pasta Brava.  We also had the empanadas de camarón, and shrimp tacos.  They have live music on weekends so it can get a bit loud.  I think we got there after the rush so it was perfect.",4
"The staff is always so welcoming and friendly. The bundts are the moist, delicious, fresh tasing cakes I have ever had. The frosting is very sweet but perfectly compliments each flavor. Lemon and white chocolate raspberry are my favorite but there isn't one that I've tried that I would turn down. These make great house warming gifts and a treat for anyone you may be visiting. Everyone is always thrilled to receive them. I prefer this instead of a traditional birthday cake. You won't be disappointed.",5
"If there is a more perfect pizza, I do not know what it would consist of: Slice on Broadway provides a pie with a delicious crust, cheese, and sauce, and the tables include containers of grated cheese, pepper flakes, and fresh oregano.  The staff is generally pleasant and accommodating and works well under pressure during busy times.  At $17 for a large plain pizza including tax, the product is not overpriced and offers value by ballpark standards.  The young gentleman who appears to be the manager is always welcoming and gracious to me and my companions.  I miss Slice on Broadway during the Pirates offseason and the restaurant makes my visits to the ballpark much more enjoyable: bravo!",5
"I generally love Divine Threading. It's close to home, comfortable, affordable, and consistent. However, WHERE'S SARA?? I've been coming in for a few months and my brows look best when done by her. I went in a few days ago and was informed that Sara no longer works there. Does anyone know if she transferred to a different location?",4
"To call this company ""professional"" is a huge exaggeration.  I've had 2 houses cleaned, one that was cleaned twice because what was specifically supposed to be done was NOT done.  Because Matt was so nice over the phone, I gave them a second chance.  HUGE mistake.  Learned my lesson.  I don't know who thought these people how to clean, but none of the ""cleanings"" we received could hardly be considered acceptable.  I'm so disappointed in how things were handled and honestly shocked that this place is still even in business.  Run.  Run FAR away from
this company.  Save time and money and clean yourself.",1
"Unfortunately I decided to opt out of takeout and actually dine in for once. Big mistake. I always get to-go food here and it's consistently fair to middling. The same or less can be said for my food tonight, I had the lotus roll which has spicy tuna inside among other ingredients, but there was no spice at all. Pretty flavorless on the whole. But, the thing that really put me off of this place was the service. It was 845 pm, just got out of yoga and needed food and possibly a drink... Head to the bar where I'm greeted with a super unfriendly bartender who- right off the bat, instead of hello, I get a bristly l ""do you need a drink menu?""... Maybe she had been having a bad day? She was somewhat helpful selecting the sake I ordered. She was on her phone/computer the whole time, didn't smile once and honestly made me slightly uncomfortable, I felt as if I was a burden. I definitely won't be back to dine in.",2
"I needed a quick fix on an old vacuum ....
These guys fixed it fast and cheap ...
They fixed my vacuum in 15 minutes ....
Fast great service !",5
"Like this place, the staff is nice... it's a good place to chill but of course there are still room for improvement.",4
Good basic Chinese food. Lunch special is good including tea for under $5. Doesn't include eggroll though.,4
"Ever since Penguingate I've been so ready for the Diamond to open.  And then it did.  And due to transportation issues, I couldn't go.  Not until last week!  Despite lots of interaction with the twitter (they #FFed me!  *tear*  true love!)  and staring moodily and jealously at my friend's frequent foursquare check-ins, i just COULD NOT manage a way to get myself in those doors.  And then I did.  

I'm actually glad I wasn't able to come for so long because it seems like they're really in stride now, as opposed to the early hiccups that come from being a super-hyped, newly opened restaurant in a fiercely loyal neighborhood.  I heard about all the kinks and wrung my hands with worry...but I think we're okay now.  

Immediately upon entering my friend and I were summoned to the bar for hugs...we knew literally every person sitting there, including the hostess and a few of the waiters.  It being a monday night, it wasn't super crowded and we got our table lickety-split.  Of course I had to try the small block and the fried pickles first...duh.  

And they did NOT disappoint.  Everything I loved about the Bird's burger, yet somehow even better than I remembered!  Maybe it's because I chose to love them before I even tried the food, most likely it's because it's just that good.  The fried pickles were also just as I remembered them.  I can't wait to try the new stuff, now, particularly the po greek boy and the crab dip.  

Also, despite hearing a lot of stories about super long waits, our orders were taken and the food was brought out super fast.  

Great prices, great food, great atmosphere, great people, great location...this really deserves it's WOOHOO!  As good as it gets!  review from me.  I'll be back.  I may move in.",5
I absolutely loved prepared food. Wonderful place! Beautiful! Excellent selection. Amazing deserts and coffee. Great service. Absolutely five stars!,5
"French fries were amazing!!! Drinks are spot on! 

We had the bbq chicken pizza and the meat lovers, both were awesome!! 

Friendly staff, and quick service!",5
"This was the most disappointing display of hospitality! The drinks were bad from start to finish - I've never left a bad review btw - food was ok - it took 30 minutes to get a drink, like every time u spoke to the waitress, you knew it was going to take 30 minutes till she came back. This is across from an event center!!! They should be prepared and trained for Saturday nights! And it's atleast 3 years old.",1
"I love this store.  It is always clean, the employees are always friendly, and the prices are very comparable to Wal-Mart. There are always ample checkout lanes open so the wait is not long, and the selection is very good!",5
"2.5 stars but I'll round up because everything in Vegas is pricey. 

The atmosphere about this place is cool.  So for those tired of going to upscale Vegas restaurants, this is a good place to chill and drink some frozen margaritas and relax.  Especially a good way to get out of the Vegas heat.

Order the Carne Asada tacos and it was nothing special.  Tacos were a little small but it was good.   But its no way it should be 17 dollars.  Anywhere else and this would be a taco plate appetizer.  Grabbed some shots of tequila that were $11 dollars as well.  Overall just a meh experience. 

Again the 3 stars is generous because everything in Vegas is high.  And our waitress was really cool.  But otherwise it would be more towards that 2-2.5 range.",3
"The food tastes great... However, as I walked in there's only one lady at the front ringing in orders and answering phones. The line is to the door. I tried to call our order in before I left work but phone lines were busy or disconnected so we had to place our order once we got there.  We finally got to the front and ordered our food at 12:05. We received our food at 12:46, after I asked where it was. (There were about 30 people waiting for their food at this point )  They didn't even have our order, they found half of it but had to make my husband's. After receiving our food mine was not even hot anymore because it had been sitting out. I also had to leave to go back to work and left my husband eating alone. I got an apology but it ruined my lunch. I wouldn't recommend going here on lunch break. Food is good but not worth the trouble.",2
"I expected to much of this place I guess. It was super loud (every single time someone comes in, leaves, or comes in to got to WC from the patio they YELL bunch of things in some sort of asian language). Gets a little annoying and very hard to have any kind of conversation with your partner at the table.

Very expensive for the amount/portions. Left around 55$ for two people and none of us were full. Pretty much 55$ for a beer and 2-3 appetizers. The black cod was very good but VERY SMALL and costs almost 20$.

Will not come back not worth it at all. Like - regrets are real.",2
Went in to replace a pair of running shoes that I had for 5 years. The 2 ladies working there were great. They were busting my chops (along with another male customer) the entire time and made the entire experience very pleasurable. It is obvious that they enjoy their jobs and it makes shopping here a very pleasurable experience.,5
Breakfast sandwiches over in the deli are only $2.49 from 7am-10am and are soooo delicious! The girl at the counter was super nice! Starbucks crew is awesome! Great store!,4
"The Original Nello's -- Established 1983 -- has been serving by far the best pizza. And it's not just the pizza, it's the whole menu.

We will Defenitly come back again.",5
"Two stars includes the very nice waiter's service. Other then that, it would of been a star, star and half top!

We came on a Sunday evening, we're on vacation. I made sure by calling them to ask if the fish is fresh of the day or not. The reason why is that they were going to be closed for the next two days and that i wanted to be sure they weren't going to be serving us leftover seafood. The person on the phone assured me that it's always fresh from the day and that they are ""used"" to being opened on Sundays. ""Do not worry 'mam. You will not get food poisoning!"" Ok 

There was total six guests including my husband and I. Slow night?! Plus, we had to wait about 30-40 minutes in between services. I also saw the sushi Chef running around like a headless chicken at one point. Was he the only kitchen staff? Anyways let's just get to business. 

We got:

Signature house cocktail. Very good and original. But small drink and expensive! 

Miso soup
Vichyssoise soup
Tuna tartar ""cappuccino"" entrée
A sake bomb entrée
The maki plate assortment
The ""chef d'oeuvre"" plate assortment
Molten chocolate cake
Crème brûlée duo. 

The soups were ok. My main concern was my entrée the tuna tartar with it's viscous, slimy weird tasting foam. The tuna was FAR from fresh. I had a hard time swallowing it. At one point i just wanted to run to the bathroom or just spit it out! It was THAT bad! Felix hard ordered the beef tataki but they didn't have it so they offered him the sake bomb. A fried rice ball with salmon. It was ok. Sushis now. We got a total of 30 pieces and ended up eating about 8-9 pieces total! Those pieces didn't have raw fish in them. The ones with the raw seafood were ""weirdly different"" then what we are used to. The freshness wasn't there! The only success from the evening was the desserts. They were surprisingly delicious! Thankfully the waiter was very nice and attentive! But was it because we were only six??? 

I would NEVER recommend anyone to go there for sushi. Perhaps the french bistro side is better. I will never know because i will NOT be coming back. The concept is original but i don't think that French cuisine and Japanese cuisine mesh well together.

We both got upset stomachs...",2
My only criticism is that it's a little pricey and hard to get into or get reservations. Otherwise a great late night snack or pre-theater dinner.,4
"Usually a Morton's guy but my son wanted this for his BDay & I hadn't tried them yet....very good food, from apps to dessert we were quite satisfied! A couple notes: the lobster bisque was a bit watery but still tasted great...my filet was more medium well than medium...other than these minor issues the food was great! Now I have to mention the reservation issue...I reserved a table online, received confirmation AND a phone call to confirm...OK, done...when we get to the greeter they didn't have our name?!!?! I was told they had us down for the next day...ok, your fault not mine...they sat us down & everything was fine...I even got a cancellation message for the reservation I didn't make??!! Again, minor stuff for what was a great night out!",4
"Still looking for a solid taco place. I had high hopes for this place. Although it was good, it was not great. I am a huge fan of tripa, buche, and lengua tacos all of which were delicious! Only downside is they are a bit greasy so the tortilla falls apart and hard to eat. The plus is the tortillas are hand made corn tortillas. The carne asada was not seasoned so it was a bit bland. I will for sure come back.",3
"This was my first visit to the newest Las Vegas Trader Joe's location.  It's in Downtown Summerlin, which is new enough and far enough west that parking is still abundant.  Once the rest of the shopping center is fully occupied, parking might be more of a challenge.

This location feels much larger than the Henderson and Decatur locations I'm used to.  I was just in time for the first shipment of the seasonal dried mandarin orange slices.  But my usual purchase, the mini cocoa batons, was out.  So were the butter waffle cookies and butter almond thins, the most popular items that Hawaii visitors buy to take back.

The staff are as friendly as I've come to expect from a Trader Joe's.  I was asked twice if I could use assistance as I went through the store.  Those who answered my questions did so happily.  Checking out was quick and efficient.",5
"Beware using technology like websites and email with this company!!!

I would say you should call, or maybe send a carrier pigeon or something that they can handle better than today's advanced technology.

Unfortunately I never got to find out how they were in an actual move because there were 2 different times when they supposedly didn't get what I submitted (both via the website and through email.)

I ended up moving my furniture in near record breaking Phoenix heat with the help of my parents who are in their 60's because they couldn't manage to set up a move for me.

My recommendation would be to make sure you either do things by phone to confirm that they have in fact received the information you have attempted to send, or to ask for a return email to verify receipt of your message. If you haven't heard back in a few hours, send another one and another until they respond. 

The first issue was with the website. I filled out the ""Inventory Form"" and hit ""Submit"". It then kicked me back to the company's home page, so I figured that was what it does when the form is submitted. I waited and waited. Several days later I emailed Lynette asking what the status was. She said she never received it. Awesome. Evidently the website didn't work properly, but there was no indication of that to me. So...if you hit submit, just know that you should get some kind of notification. I did it again and it worked. Gave me sort of a summary of what I sent so I could keep a record. That's nice, but when it doesn't work, there's no way to know that it didn't work.

The second issue was through email. I was back and forth a couple times with Lynette after the first issue, so I knew she normally responded promptly. I emailed to confirm that I wanted to schedule the move as quoted and asked at the end what my next step would be. Didn't hear back for a couple days. So I emailed again to ask about the status and again...she says she never got it. Well...it was sent via ""Reply"" on my side to an email that she sent me. It's in my stream of emails and shows that it went through so I don't know what happened to it on her end. 

What I DO know is that by the time I emailed to inquire, they had booked up the time that had been quoted to me and she said she didn't have any dates available until a week after I have to be out of my place. She did add that she could do July 4th weekend but it would be at a higher holiday rate. I have to be out by June 30th, so even at a higher rate, I couldn't even consider that. 

You would think that maybe if you gave out a quote and hadn't heard back from the customer, before you book up the time slot you quoted for, you might call them and ask if they still needed it? That might be a great time to find out that you aren't getting emails that customers are sending for whatever reason. 

But I guess that would take 2 minutes so I guess that's an absurd idea on my part. Yeah...just book the time to someone else. The person who filled out the entire inventory sheet and did all the steps up to the part where you confirm and request a credit card number...that 34 year old chick who lives alone probably doesn't really neeeeed a mover. Maybe she was just throwing the idea around and changed her mind...decided to move her own furniture by herself in 115 degree temperatures. That's probably it. 

All those good reviews are nice. I wish I would've gotten to find out what a great job the movers could do, but due to more than one clerical error I didn't get to the actual moving phase with them.",1
"This is the best Mexican food I have ever had in the U.S.  Maybe even in Mexico. I have been looking for a place that doesn't just serve Border food.  If you want something different and exceptional go to this place.
The food is not only delicious, its really special and makes you want to come back.  The servings are large which means you can take some home.  The deserts are so good, that you really feel guilty.  The service is amazing.  I felt like I was in Heaven and would highly recommend this place.  The manager Geoffrey gives special treatment to each of his customers.  You can sit outside on the patio if you want.  I tried both.  I loved being inside and cant wait to go back.  I really mean that.  Its about time that that we have authentic food here in Scottsdale.",5
Was in Cleveland recently because my son was having surgery at the Cleveland Clinic.  The Fairmount was walking distance from our AirBNB;  this place turned out to be a wonderful find!  The drinks were great; food was delicious; and the nicest servers we have dealt with in a long time.  Truly a great place for us to unwind after long days in the hospital; and a real neighborhood gem.,4
"The sandwich was good, however it better be for $10 and that doesn't include a drink.  I asked directions to a washroom and they said they didn't have one.
The man at the counter said I had to use the one across the road at ST.Mike's Hospital......WTF.",2
"I went here on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch since I was in this area. I went here based on the review and as well as wanting to try Indonesian food which I have never had. It was a friendly clean dinning place with tables and booths to sit at. I sat at a booth and looked over their menu that had sushi options, noodle options, rice options, and also their special Indonesian menu. I started with their spring rolls as their appetizers. It came in pieces of four with a dipping sauce. I am not a big fan of sweet dipping sauce with my spring rolls but this dipping was very delicious. The spring roll itself was warm, crispy and had alot of flavor. For dinner I ordered their Pad Kee Mau which was a stir fry noodles with chicken and shrimp, Padangnese Rice which comes with rice, curry, kale curry, egg and with the choice of beef or roasted chicken. I choose roasted chicken as my protein and I'm so glad I did! I also ordered the Hibachi sandwich with beef which i thought was really interesting. It came with fries! Overall the Pad Kee Mau was very flavorful and tasty. The noodles and the meat was cooked perfectly. The Padangnese Rice was a very unique dish I have ever had. It had so much flavor, taste, and tenderness to it. The portion of this dish was large and presentation itself was very pretty. And the Hibachi sandwich was my least favorite because it wasn't any special or bad about it. The food is really good from here, the place is nice and clean, the service is very friendly and attentive, and I will definitely be back here to try more things!",4
Came in during lunch. Pretty busy inside but nice atmosphere has a really nice patio seating area. Got the garlic knots as an appetizer very good! Got the margarita pizza with sausage on it super yummy!,4
All these people care about is getting paid. This is not a review by someone who has only been there once. I have taken 2 dogs and a cat there for years and spent thousands of dollars.  They are condescending and do not communicate with each other.  They are not good at checking previous history of our visits.  I am glad others have had a positive experience but every time I go in there it makes me cringe inside. My wife did not share my opinion and that is why we continued to go there. After today's visit where they were rude to her and accused her of being a bad pet owner she finally agrees with me. We will be switching vets and would not recommend this place to anyone,1
the best tacos i have ever had.  very unique tacos done perfectly.  great service as well.,5
"I came here on a friend's recommendation. Know that they do have vegetarian/vegan options in addition to what's usually on the menu (yay). Service was great and the food was served hot, which I appreciated. We thought they were a little light on the salt/seasonings but would love to check this place out again in the winter.",4
"This is a Review for https://www.budget.com.
I was a victim of a Bait & switch. I needed to rent a vehicle that could hold 7 people. I picked a cadillac escalade and used Budgets ""PayNow"" and saved a few bucks. I did everything online, reserved the car and paid. My email confirmation said I rented a Jeep Wrangler.- I NEVER even looked at that vehicle. WTF. Long story short after calling Customer service 1 min after confirmation, they said I had to pay $50 to cancel the reservation or $922 to upgrade to a cadillac escalade. This is what I get from straying from alamo.....I paid the $50 and now I hate them!",1
"I recently bought a used Acadia from Coulter Tempe,  I wasn't fully happy with the vehicle and wanted to look at something else after the purchase.. I went and talk to Jim and he just didn't seem too interested and helping me find something.. he showed me 2 suv's and didnt budge on the price.. I called earlier that day and was told by another sales person that they were trying to move the vehicles I was interested in and that the price was negotiable.. Jim was just like ... this is it take it or leave it attitude.. I left with the vehicle I purchased and now have to drive it a few years before I can unload it.. :(  
I will say though the service dept. and used car mgr. Tim was great in getting me a new battery when mine died the day after purchase and fixing the loose drivers seat track .. although I had to pay for the broken casing around it.. 
my dad use to buy all his cars from coulter... this is my first time... not sure how Im feeling right now... just wish there was more care in making me happy when I went back unhappy..",2
"OK experience.  Not likely to go back given all the other options in Vegas.  Surprised at how strong many of the reviews are.  I feel misled by Yelp on this one.

Service was great.  Ambiance not great.  You are in a shopping mall and you will be starting across the mall at retail stores and shoppers.

Food quality was good, but expensive for ambiance.  Good balance of seafood and steak house.",3
"All you need to know is they broke my rear window which they replaced but left broken glass everywhere. When I picked up my car they said the glass just exploded from nowhere  but don't worry price was $188 only pay $170... I had to go back after leaving because there was a big gap without tint on one of the rear door windows. On the 4th day I roll down my windows and front door is already peeling. Went back and ask them to fix and clean the broken glass which you can hear between metal and carpet every time I turn. When I pick up the car left and realize they put the wrong color, had to go back again.  This place is a joke. I ask them to reimburse the cab used the second time I left the car there which they did. I went to this place because of Yelp reviews and is the worse place I used to tint windows.",1
"I've been here several times, but I never reviewed it before.  We went here tonight and had a great meal.  Standard chips and 4 salsas were brought.  The salsas are tomatillo, fire roasted tomato, regular tomato salsa, and a bean dip.  They're all good, but my favorite is the fire roasted.

We started with table side made guacamole, and it was very good.  I got it not spicy because my wife is the ultimate gringa.  I put all the peppers on my side of the bowl after our server had finished.  How gringa is she you ask?  If you wave a pepper over the plate, she'll say it's too spicy.  Enough said.

For the main course, I got the carne asada platter, slices of skirt steak with pasilla chiles and cotija cheese.  With it comes a cheese enchilada, some pico, and sides of veggies and black beans (my choice but there are other beans or Mexican potatoes available.  My wife had the pollo ranchero.  It's the most gringa thing on the menu.  She also had the sides but thought they were spicy (they weren't).  Each entree comes with a salad with your choice of dressing.  I've always thought this was odd for a Mexican restaurant.

For dessert, we shared a chocolate pecan ball which is a vanilla bean ice cream ball dipped in chopped pecans and has chocolate drizzled over it!  It was excellent.

I have a snack for TV time tonight.  I can finish my chips and guacamole while watching Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.",4
Good food but WAAAYYY too expensive for what you are getting. For $3 you can get 1 taco that consists of a tortilla and steak bits. That's it. The fish taco were a little more expensive but worth it. A side of chips was $3 which I think was not worth the cost for a small bag of chips.,3
"My review is based on my experience with the management, not the food. The food is just ok, nothing to write home about. Secret pizza at Cosmo is better.

The manager on duty failed to do his duties when I requested him to call security to come assist me when I was being harassed by a drunk belligerent man while in line. I felt unsafe and wanted security to come but the manager NEVER CALLED them. He in fact lied to me saying that they were too busy to assist me. I spoke to security later on that night and they told me they never received a call. 

SHAME ON YOU manager on duty Sunday 1:30AM for lying about calling security.",1
"I drop off anywhere from 8 to 12 blouses (button ups) every two weeks to be medium starched and laundered/pressed. Not only do I receive all my shirts back in less than 48 hrs, I walk in, get greeted and they remember me by name (I tend to lose my tickets)!! My mom used to own dry cleaners so I'm pretty particular with who I let touch my clothes..... Green World takes my bet any day in Vegas!! Only reason for a 4: depending on who presses my shirts, I sometimes (and I mean once in a blue moon) have multiple creases on my sleeves which bug the crap out of me! Other than that, great service, decent prices, great turn around!! :))",4
"This place was great! I did have trouble finding it, but that turned out to be half the charm- it was so nice to eat in a relaxed, quiet environment. The prices were high, but not ridiculously so- I had the Spaghetti Carbonara, a glass of the house pinot grigio, and tiramisu for $50 including tip. The food tasted excellent. Their bread, which was lightly garlicky, drizzled with olive oil and parmesan, was great. They set some very nice olive oil and balsamic on your table for you to dip it in. My only complaint- I ate there alone, and they seated another couple directly beside me despite other tables being open. Overall, I look forward to eating there again!",5
"When you have a craving for meat... a burger here will do the trick.
Unfortunately there are TV screens throughout and it is very noisy inside.
You may sit out on patio but then you are inhaling gas fumes from passing cars.
Service is ok, you're treated more like a number as opposed to a real person.
It's like ....the faster they serve you the faster you are out of there for another person.",4
"horrible food.  tacky, dirty atmosphere.  honestly i'll never go back, the food quality is incredibly subpar.",1
"MTO is a great place for brunch in downtown Vegas!  It is definitely located off the beaten path but don't let that deter you.  The ambiance inside is really cool and modern.  Lots of windows and natural light pouring in which is pleasantly perfect for mid-morning brunch.

We were a group of 5 and had to wait about 15 minutes for a table but we didn't mind.  We sat at a big high top by the window.  Our server was very friendly and spent some time joking with our table.  The lunch menu looks great as well!  

- $15 bottomless mimosas or bloodys.  Not a bad deal but they are a little slow on the refills 

- egg dishes were great; you can order them as a wrap, skillet or omelette.  You just get some sliced tomatoes with the omelette which is a little unfortunate for the price

- if you like pancakes, get the vegan carrott and coconut pancakes!  don't let the vegan part turn you off.  These were delish

- mash hash - yum!  basically hash browns on top of mash potatoes.  Can't believe I've never thought of that one before.    

- And don't forget the free chocolate chip cookie for checking in on yelp!  fresh out of the oven.",5
"Love the sandwich. However Aloha our order taker could use some developing. Never smiled, never looked at us, never thanked and had a frown the entire time. Did get a thanks by one of the guys while leaving.",4
I recommend Nick highly.  this is the second time I have needed his services and as usual was prompt  and solved the problem quickly.,5
"Don't come here when you are hungry because the food didn't come 40 minutes later. Wasn't busy and only  few customers in the restaurant and I still don't understand why the food took so long???

We came 6 people for lunch at 1:30 and we were waiting and waiting for our food, oh man I wish I brought my own food to Munchies while we were waiting.

The waitress forgot to bring a glass of water for my husband and he was afraid to ask maybe will take another half an hour.

The food was OK, it wasn't our good day that day.",2
"After the new owners took over a few years back Rio Rico's has become one of our favorite Mexican food restaurants. The food is excellent, two staples of Mexican cuisine that too many get wrong are guacamole and beans. Rio Rico's has fresh, homemade beans and the guacamole is made  to order. My family and I have tried many of there dishes and have never been disappointed, their giant quesadilla with shredded beef, steak, or chicken is simple yet delicious every time.",5
Cool place / small but fun - great happy hour! Bartenders very nice and friendly- love the music and crowd is always interesting ! .,5
Brand new Subway store opened just a week or so ago!  Very convenient in the Fry's Superstition Springs shopping complex.,5
"I love so many things about Sprouts! Great prices, wonderful selection on fruits and veggies. Produce is always fresh. Impressive selection of vitamins and supplements and personal care products. Went in this morning to look for a particular supplement, and the very helpful CS person came to my rescue.

I love the bulk bins. They're always clean, and a great bargain.

You should comparison shop -- WinCo and Trader Joe's sometimes have the same for less. But overall, great store!

This is the flagship store in Arizona, and it needs updating.That's why I didn't give 5 stars -- you should put some money into this store!

 But the employees are always friendly, and you can't beat the prices on produce.",4
"We came here with a group as part of our cultural experience in Montreal, hoping it would be representative of the city's historically vibrant Jewish community. Instead, it was a series of cliches stitched together with mediocre food and lackluster service. 

When we arrived, our table was not quite ready, so we waited in the dimly-lit vestibule filled with artifacts from years past. The old menus and photographs were charming and helped explain some of the restaurant's success: clearly they are coasting on a longtime reputation for quality, although they are not upholding it today.

Upon being seated, we were presented with bread and pickles, both huge dill pickles and a mayonnaise-free cole slaw. I know this is their trademark and they won't ever change it, but I don't think a giant pickle is an appropriate amuse-bouche for a steak dinner, and the coleslaw was much too sweet to be enjoyable (the caraway seeds were a nice touch, though.) The waiter answered our questions with as few words and as much condescension as possible: when we asked what made the Special Chicken ""Special"" he rattled off a list of ingredients, and when my husband asked for a wine list he brought him an iPad with the reserve list (hundreds or thousands of dollars per bottle) instead of pointing out that the normal-priced selections were on a different page of the menu. He opted for a cocktail instead.

Our appetizers came: the salmon tartare was very small, the cesar salad overdressed and the house salad uneventful. A long wait for our main courses. The Special Chicken was decent, but overly sweet (a pinch of sugar in the dry rub is nice, but this was practically caramelized!) The steaks were decent as well, though one was underdone and when my friend sent it back it arrived overdone. The best steak restaurants I have visited will confirm your preference so that you know what to expect (medium will have a warm pink center, etc.) but as I mentioned, our waiter couldn't be bothered. Sides are not included, but my husband and I shared a monte carlo potato for $5, which passable but not wonderful. We skipped dessert, and as we were waiting for our check, we heard two separate disagreements over bills at neighboring tables (not shouting matches, but loud enough to be heard.) It didn't bode well, but thankfully everything was in order.

Moishe's idea of an after-9 menu with lower prices is an excellent one, but I imagine their goal is to whet our tastebuds for the finery we can expect at other hours. Instead, it cut every possible corner, from portions to service. We had a great time at dinner because we're all good friends and took the missteps in stride, but I didn't experience anything that would make me want to return even for a bargain meal, let alone a full-priced one. Good food is easy to find in Montreal at any price point, but not here!",2
I come to Dolce pretty much every time I'm eating on the Danforth. There's lots of seating and it's usually clean. Plenty of flavors to choose from. My new favourite is their blueberry - so fresh! I always see the same guy working there. Gelato is pretty pricey these days and this place goes for average price. You can buy take home containers starting at $12 but you can't eat it there.,4
"Too close to home! This location is great for us, it's busy but there's always some space, and a nice semi-outdoors one too. If you haven't had their Peruvian chicken, then get that first along with the cilantro rice. It's a great alternative to all the fried chickens out there in Charlotte. The whole chicken and 3 sides deal is pretty good for 2 people, but not if you're hungry. I now get the arroz chaufa w/ chicken and she gets the tacu bowl which adds more substance for the $10 each price point. We usually pass on the desserts, minus the fried plantains, which is really considered a side. Yep, definitely get the fried plantains.",4
"Worst customer service EVER! None of them would even crack a smile and I was super nice to them. I asked the guy to razor my feet and he told me the stuff he used would be sufficient. Then when my nails were drying I notice my feet are still rough and dry so I show him. He gets all mad and when someone else stepped in to take care of it he was shooting nasty looks at me from his nail station. Not to mention it was the worst massage ever. Do NOT go to this place! It's awful. I will NEVER go here again. Go to La Vie nails just outside the mall. They are so nice there! 

Also, while I was there I heard another customer get upset and say she would never be back. Looks like they make a lot of customers unhappy.",1
"Good sandwich and nice young lady deliver to the LV convention center. We ordered the turkey sandwich and Ms. Piggy, both were delicious and came with some green salad. We loved it!",5
"Needed a quick bite before work. Ordered green tropical smoothie, iced chai latte, and turkey sausage tacos. Even the salsa is amazingly delicious. Service was quick and efficient. The food smelled so good as soon as the windows opened. Love this place!",5
All you can eat dinner is worth the price. $26.95 dinner. Delicious flavors. Very different creations. And the appetizers and desert are included. Big menu. A lot to choose from.,5
"These guys are the best! I had an valet driver scrape my passenger side rear quarter panel causing an obvious 18 inch paint skid. I only had a couple hours to see if they could make it go away before returning the vehicle. Josh jumped right on it taking his lunch hour to get the buffing compounds and start working. Oh, and the owner (sorry forgot his name) gave me a ride back to my hotel. 

90 minutes later they came back to the hotel with the car done. It looked 100% better and no hassle at the rental car agency. They could have up charged me for that legendary service, but the charge was reasonable, and significantly less then the $1,000 deductible. This shop doesn't specialize in auto body work, but they kicked ass for me. Thanks again guys!!",5
"Nice place to eat. Wasn't amazing or anything, but I liked their pizza. Got a 12 inch pie for just 10 bucks and the bread dough they use for the pizza was quite tasty. Good stuff, wouldn't mind eating there again :)",3
"I cant say enough good things about this dealership, especially with Ana Corbo in the service dept.  She is always straight to the point, thoroughly explains any work that may be needed and always very personable.  She has a way of making an otherwise  very stressful dept seem like a breeze and completly stress free!!!  Thank you Ana!

Also, my car is always cleaned after servicing for a nice touch and the customer lounge is set up pretty well if youre going to be waiting for the service to be finished.",5
Amazing photographer! Professional and got my photos within 24hrs. I would absolutely recommend Brian Brown!,5
I love the Lad Na here so much that I had it twice in one day.  Great customer service!,4
"I ordered the much recommended hachapuri and 2 orders of khinkali (dumplings). I gotta say the flavours of Georgian cuisine is quite unique. These dishes seemed to be made to order because it took quite some time to receive. It may have been more than half an hour.
My favorite would be the hachapuri. It makes me think of having pizza but the cheese is distinctly salty and they roll up the boat edges with cheese so the crust is a delight to eat. I wish there were 2 eggs. It definitely balanced the saltiness of the cheese (feta?). It seemed like there were 2 layers of cheese: the crusty top and a layer of soft chese below.
The khinkali reminds me of Chinese dumplings but the flavours are truly very different from what I'm used to. It was creamy and dark. Each serving contained 3 dumplings  which doesn't seem like a lot but it really is like its own meal. It definitely needed something to cut the heaviness.
While waiting for the food, we got complimentary appetizers: bread, pickled cabbage and an array of sauces (tomato, Georgian, spicy). The sauces and the pickled cabbage all have tastes I am not familiar with. I ate it all because the food was taking so long to come. The pickled cabbage I did not like so much.
All in all, the service was good, the food was filling and I was satisfied.",4
Had friends in from Florida. We wanted to go out for a fun night of karaoke on the last night in town. The bartender a blonde middle age lady. Accused us of having fake I.D.s and that a passport isn't a valid form of I.D. So the 20 of us left and went to JDublins!!!,1
My new all time favorite lunch spot especially if you are looking for healthier options for a good price. They are in the same category as Paradise Bakery and Wildflower but in my mind much better and more cost effective for what you get. They are efficient going down the line and very have friendly Customer Service. Not to mention the desserts are amazing for those with a sweet tooth!,5
Worst Sushi I have ever had. Fish seems old with a smell and taste like it's been sitting for 3 or more days in frig. There is an after taste when eating. The roll looks well rolled but some  looked pre rolled not just done for you. Sorry inexperience diners may not notice with all the sauces but I am from the islands and know good fresh sushi. Oh..Sauce on fish is good. If that makes up for the aged fish.,1
"Decided to stop by this place for take away since it was nearby and I was pleasantly surprised. Honestly coming from my Orlando/Kissimmee, Florida vacay to Pittsburg I gave up on asian food from the east coast. The Viet and Thai restaurants we went to were either tasteless, over-salted, or more on the Asian/America fusion  type flavor(which isn't bad but just not the home cooking/heavy asian food I enjoy). We ordered the chicken pad kee mao (drunken noodle), chicken basil stir fry, and chicken tom kha soup. 

The chicken pad kee mao's flavor was on point! The noodle they used tasted freshly made which is oh so important in any asian noodle dish. It makes the dish 5x better. The veggies weren't overly cooked and still had a nice bite to them. I prefer having ground meat in my noodle stir-frys but they use sliced chicken. I was worried about the chicken being cut to thick like a lot of restaurants do but they slice the chicken real thin to where some pieces get broken up during the cooking process. Delish! I ordered level 7 spice and it tasted like nothing but the lady did give a side of dry pepper just in case. 

The chicken basil stir fry was good but could've been great. It has a good flavor foundation, what you would expect from thai chicken basil stir fry. If someone was newly introduce to Thai food and got this dish they would've loved it because it's not too much of a 'in your face' flavor. For me, I would've enjoyed a splash or two more of fish sauce and some more pepper. It would've been magical but
still a great dish though.

The chicken tom kha soup. It was cooked perfectly to what I know Thai food to taste like but I just wished there was a bit more of a sour taste. That's just preference though.

The steamed rice was cooked well. Not too hard but not overly cooked and left jelly like.


As for the service it was great in terms of going into the restaurant and ordering for to go. The lady at the register didn't have the most warming outward appearance and vibe but she was nice, did her job well and went above and beyond. She took my order, helped me in terms of spice levels at their restaurant(told me she would put pepper on the side and did it immediately before the food check even got to the back), and offered us water as we were waiting for the food and informed us that it was filtered since their has been 'led in water' breakout news. 

The food was quick to come out.. maybe 20ish minutes from placing the order. They don't use styrofoam containers instead they pack the food in nice, thick plastic containers that could be washed and used to pack lunch.

Great experience overall and would revisit to dine-in.",4
"I have been to Fran's for lunch, dinner and even just drinks and appetizers. Every time I have  been impressed. The funky and higher casual vibe is welcoming as you walk in. The staff are relaxed and knowledgeable. You can tell the food is fresh, hand-crafted and made with love. So nice to find a small business with great food that is not a chain! I also like how Fran puts news on her Facebook feed so I know when her meatloaf is ready for me to drive on over...",5
"Awful, awful service. Completely ignored while employees yucked it up in the kitchen and behind the counter. The meal was unremarkable and overpriced. Don't waste your time or money.",1
"I love seeing shows here! Hands down it's the best places to see a band in Phoenix. 

What's so great about Crescent? First, they have a lot of fantastic local and national acts that play here. It's big enough for a mid-sized national band, but it still feels intimate. Also, I'm way too old to stand for an entire concert if I don't have to, so I appreciate the bleacher seats in the back. I don't always use them, but it's nice to know I can.

As far as food and drinks go, Crescent is solid. They have a decent craft beer selection and the food is good. The menu is fairly simple, but what they have is tasty. The bartenders and servers have always been quick and attentive.

Also, on Sunday nights they do a decent trivia. It's pretty eclectic, but it's a good time. They give out pretty awesome prizes to the top 6 or so teams including various gift cards, random gift baskets (like a bacon-themed one), concert tickets and various kitchy items. Last time we played we won a lucha libre action figure- score!",5
"I have spent numerous months checking yelp and trying different nail salons and while I was really never dissapointed with them I found all of the top ones to be the same nothing to complain about but nothing to make them stand out. That was until I found Kimberly at the Indian school location. that day she actually was not the one who did my nails but she was helping my nail tech  and Kimberly  seemed genuinely interested in me being satisfied with my gel manicure.  a few weeks later I happened to go to the other location on McDonald  and Kimberly just happened to be there!
 I Beleive she works between both the Indian school and McDonald  locAtion. I was lucky enough to have her do my gel nail manicure this time  and all I can say is wow. she did almond shape nails With glitter hombre and they came out beautiful. What sets her aside from other techs is her attention to detail. She was very very careful making sure to get the shape I wanted. I felt she took pride in her work and actually enjoys what she does  which is very hard to find these days!! I needed suggestions on color and style and she was eager to give her suggestions and opinions. She is very nice,personable,knowledgable and is extremely talented.  I will be returning and following Kimberly whichever location she is at because it's hard to find someone like her!",5
"Tasty burger and chicken sandwich. For the price though, I'll be going elsewhere. I've been waiting a long time for shake shack to open in phoenix and was hoping it'd be worth it but my opinion is it's not. Hopdoddy happy hour or a few other local places you'll get more bang for the buck.",3
"Definitely my fave sushi restaurant in Henderson.  Ambiance is relaxed and friendly, service is efficient, price range is reasonable, sushi is delicious.",4
I travel through the city and shop at many European deli shop but the cold cuts prices at La Salumeria are absolutely ridiculous!,3
"We had never used a sitter that we didn't know so were really nervous, but our experience with Kelly was great. She was very professional and the kids had a good time. She didn't mind me checking in a few times and responded promptly to my texts. We would do this again.",5
"Where do I begin! 
Poor food, poor service and major inconsistency. Stay away!! 

I am an avid restaurant go-er who has been to my fair share of establishments in the GTA. I have never felt the need to write a poor public review about a restaurant until now. 

Service: Shore Grill and Grotto has some of the worst service. The servers are always slow and uninterested in truly assisting you and making you feel comfortable. When they make a mistake on your order (which almost ALWAYS happens ), they BLAME YOU and try to cover themselves up for making the mistake. 

Food; Food is subpar and prices are high for the quality of food you are receiving There are plenty of places you can better spend your hard earned money. 

If you thought it ended here, you are wrong! 
A few times I have ordered a simple salad for take-out. You would think that an easy to make salad would be hard to mess up... wrong! It is somehow always wrong. They either give me a half portion (not acceptable at all), completely forget to put dressing on the salad (i didn't order lettuce), or forget to tell me that the ""Kale"" to make a ""kale"" salad is unavailable yet still sell me that salad.... 
Even after I brought this stupidity to their attention... they tried to justify their actions. Completely ridiculous. 

Moral of this review: Do NOT go to Shore Grill and Grotto.",1
1st time here. Great atmosphere and decor. The falafel burger and homemade potato chips were delish! John the bartender makes an amazing strawberry mojito! Will be back!,4
"i've been the location in Tuscon years ago, and my husband and i have been DREAMING of sonoran hot dogs ever since. luckily for us, we were in phoenix, and i nearly died of  excitement when i saw there was a location in phoenix. 

it was just like i remembered! we also had the flan, which was sooo good. 

i wish we were able to sample other sonoran hot dogs while in the area, but for me, el guero canelo will hold a special place.",4
"I love this place!! I'm so glad they moved to this new location because it is only 5 minutes away from my house.... I'll probably have mixed feelings once I gain 10# from eating too much pie. I've eaten here a few times now so I'm going to lump my review all into one. If you're in a hurry here is the down and dirty- eat here! It will definitely shut your pie hole (because it will be stuffed with amazing pie!!!) 

As far as pies go, I've never had a bad one. I highly recommend the key lime and the pecan. Though the peach is also sublime. If you can eat it in store or are going to eat it as soon as you get home, ask to have your mini pie warmed up! The crust, which is already good, becomes more flakey and delicious when warmed up. I recently, also tried the strawberry rhubarb. I haven't had anything made with rhubarb since I moved to Phoenix from South Dakota and I've been missing it. This pie, though different from what I'm used to, is still very yummy. The crust is flakey and perfect like all their crusts, however, it's the filling that threw me off a bit. The texture of the filling is firmer, almost like gelatin was used. There are definitely pieces of rhubarb in the mix but I didn't notice any strawberry pieces. Maybe it's pureed before added? There is also a lemon flavor added- it creates a strawberry lemonade taste which is quite refreshing. 

I have also tried the chicken and pot roast pot pies. Again, these have perfect, flakey, buttery crusts. The chicken has shredded chicken pieces and carrots in gravy. I found this one to be a little bland. However, my boyfriend (who uses less salt then I do) loved the flavor of it. The pot roast is my favorite of the two. The meat was tender and the gravy had more flavor. The vegetables consisted of carrots and potatoes. I still need to try the pork green chili pie but I'm sure it will be on the same level as the others. I'm definitely looking forward to trying everything else here!",5
"I got a 30 minutes reflexology, the massage itself was okay. I did like the fact that the place was clean. When paying I noticed a list on the wall, it says a tip of $5 means you're ""sad"". Wow, for a $20 massage $5 tip is pretty good! But they expect $15 and up! Maybe their workers are not paid well and count on making a living with a significant portion of their income being from tips. But that's not right! The owner should pay them what they are entitled to.",2
Well what can you expect it's a Burger King. This location seems to be fairly clean in comparison to other BKs. There always seems to be long lines inside the restaurant (15 minutes wait).  The thing that spites me the most is the fact that the men washrooms needs a key but not the women's.  I guess all men are bad -_-    It's a mediocre place to get a cheap lunch.,2
"Great bar. Service was amazing. Food was amazing. I watched some rude customer yell at a bartender that gave him over the top service. I'd recommend this bar, their food, their drinks and their great bartenders to anybody.",5
"An invaluable service to the neighbourhood.  Evergreen has everything natural - supplements, personal care products, fresh foods, tinned and dry foods, spices, health products, even milk.  Pricing isn't terrible either.  The only thing keeping this review from being a five is the rotating stock.  After weeks of carrying a particular brand, it disappears.  Very happy to be a customer.",4
"Crescent Ballroom is the first venue I can think of in Phoenix that is actually a cool place to watch live music, AND eat a satisfying meal. I was intrigued when I heard it was another place to watch a good show, but it definitely became a priority when I heard that Chris Bianco (owner of Pizzeria Bianco) and Doug Robson (owner of Gallo Blanco) were in charge of the restaurant on the other side of the door.

During my first visit, we were there to support a band and only had time for chips and guac (yum), but the rest of the food looked great! I will make sure I get there with plenty of time to spare before our next trip to Crescent so i can enjoy more of what their kitchen has to offer.

As far as a music venue goes, I was impressed. Great sound, and juuuust small enough to feel intimate, but big enough to accommodate a good amount of people. Bleacher seats in the back are a nice reward for people that are early to their  show.",4
"We came here because of its convenient location right on Yonge and Finch. I got honey citrus slush this time, and it was good, but because I know how to make honey citrus slush or honey citrus tea that would taste exactly like what they served me, I felt a little appalled at having to shell out $6 before taxes and tips for a cup of honey citrus slush. I can get a jar of honey citrus (yuja in Korean; yuzu in Japanese) tea for $6. Nonetheless, I do think you pay for having a good time with a friend chatting away at a cafe. They kindly list their two wifi networks and respective wifi passwords on their menu. I thought the furniture was nice on my previous visits but I realized many princess chairs are actually in need of replacement.",3
Came back again...this time with the kids and some friends. There were 9 of us and we were seated within minutes. Love their staff. Everything was great of course. Here are some pictures of  new items we ordered.,5
Usually a nice spa...  Today my therapist decided not to come to work I guess.   Waited in my robe in the waiting room until my friends massage was done then got dressed and left.,1
This place is so clean like many Discount Tire stores. Excellent service and grey prices,5
"Wonderful staff and food. Mario, Ruben and Edna have been great to me and Dustin with their superior customer service. We eat there at least once week because of the great service.",5
I went there for the first time. I can honestly say it was the best gyro I have had in a long time. The portions were big more then I could eat well worth every penny.,5
We've been here for lunch and breakfast burritos. Have loved both and are always popping in for more breakfast burritos when time permits.,5
"8/14/10
How can I not score this place when my Man specifically made reservations to take me here for my birthday dinner number 2? When re-reading my review...I think the 4 stars were based on my experience with the FOOD here...

The ambience was very nice, casual, people came in flipflops and shorts...which is not what I had expected...sorta romantic...except for how we were 6 inches away on each side from the other couples...they were packing us in like sardines....ugh...AND the noise level was pretty LOUD. I had imagined this place to be a little more romantic and moody...but it was not...

The service was good...it was interesting that the menus were printed on paper which they took from you, so you can't even keep it as a souvenir...what we didn't appreciate was the server practically forcing us to order something as an appetizer or ""1st course"" as we would be waiting for our meals for a long while because there were people ahead of us...the bf said...No thanks we're not interested...but he repeated again several times like we were STUPID highly suggesting we get something...this put the BF in a bad mood because the server was 2nd guessing what we should be getting and not leaving us alone! I mean they give you a bowl of pistachios and bread! WHY did we have to feel pressured into ordering a salad? Which by the way did have the best goat cheese EVER..it was like BUTTERY soft and smooth...and we only waited like 15 minutes before our meals came out! WTH? 

So anyways...we both tried the specials for the evening, I had the top sirloin, he had the halibut...both were excellent! We also ordered the pomme frittes (fries) and they were just alright and too much for 2 people to eat...Also had 2 glasses of wine which paired very nicely with our meals...The 1 good suggestion we appreciated from the server...

ALL in ALL it was a very EXPENSIVE meal and we truly had way better service and food at Napa Rose for the same price...at least that's in my opinion....

I truly hope French Laundry is BETTER than this place, because I can't believe the previous review saying that they enjoyed this place even more...that's not saying much about French Laundry then...keeping fingers crossed...Overall it was a classy place...MINUS the loud and irritating stamp machine they have in the front that embosses their name and phone number one a blue square card...LAMENESS...",4
"Normally I don't go to chain places but it sounded good.  The food was actually better than expected but our service is why I felt compelled to review.  
Our waitress, Marnetta, was the most attentive server I have encountered.  She was above any beyond polite, knowledgeable of the menu, made good recommendations for my husband dinner, and was just awesome.  
If you find yourself eating here, ask for her and you won't be disappointed.  She was just amazing!",4
"When I was in dire need of Computer repair and many phones calls to find the right person, I knew from the first few minutes of talking with Joey he was the person I wanted to work on my Computer. He drove a long distance to my home, diagnosed the issues & fixed it quickly. I also wanted a new PC and called Joey and he went out of his way to look for a Computer for me with all the specifics I wanted.Which all of this was on his own time. He found the perfect machine I wanted and set it up soon after. He has been over the Internet to assist me with Problems and has been able to help from a Distance to solve quickly anything I have a problem with. I Feel Joey is ""TOP NOTCH""  and I would recommend him in a heartbeat. He is a Pro.",5
"They treated my sister like royalty!  Jack is friendly and wasn't pushy.  My sister walked in with the intention of buying one pair.  She looked at a pair of simple black leather pumps.  My friend and I got her to rethink that and she left with 2 pair of fabulous shoes!  The store is gorgeous and inviting, despite the reputation the brand has for being extravagant and posh.  I could tell it didn't matter who walked through that door, they were treated to the experience of a lifetime!",5
"Thus place wants to turn me into a fat girl with their freshly buttery grilled bun and pile of delectable beef TIMES THREE on sale!  
They've done well keeping up with the times. Reubens and sliders and fajitas et al,  but for my money, there's nothing like the classic, over-stimulated with too much  arbys sauce. I always think I'm going to try something new, but never do. 
Oh, they keep the place up pretty well considering they're right across the street from a school.",4
Best grilled sardines ever! Chouriço was perfect! I had the combo Demi-poulet & côtes levées and it was very great. 3rd time in this place in 5 years. It never disappoints.,5
"On a recent trip to Westgate our friendly tour guide suggested we get pedis here.  This place did not disappoint, taking all 3 of us on the spot and plunking us down in their luxurious (aaahhh ) massage chairs and getting our feet soaking right away.

It had been about 6 weeks since my last pedi and I was due.  In my opinion, this place was superior to the Aveda spa I had last visited. 

True confession, I had a little fall in Old Scottsdale the day before on unsteady footwear so my foot was twisted and painful.  The lady worked my feet perfectly, although a bit painfully.  But good.  I walk a ton and have calluses on the pads of my feet that really needed attention.  My feet are in much better shape now - pretty!

A bonus for us was the owner, who was a big football fan and confessed he'd bet on the Vikings to win the Super Bowl.  Then we talked Packers - the local team that has our hearts!

The best was the price.  The pedicures started for a mere $32.  I paid $40.  One of my friends got paraffin and paid more.  Well worth it for this luxury!

Thanks again for the great treatment!",4
We used Tim Merziotis at Scofield Realty to purchase a new home and to sell our old home. Could not be happier with the entire process for both transactions. Tim and his team at Scofield were everything we hoped for and more. I absolutely recommend Tim for anyone looking to purchase or sell a home.,5
"Probably my favourite Indian Chinese restaurant in Toronto. The service and the food, both were fantastic. I ordered the Manchurian style chicken and Chicken Hakka noodles. Delicious!!!! Just amazing. I got hot and sour soup to start with. The temperature, flavour, consistency everything was just perfect. And I ended my lunch with their mango lassi which was so refreshing with just enough sweetness. Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu.",5
Momocho has one of the best happy hours around!  But you have to get there early.  The happy hour is only available on the first floor and the place fills up quickly.  I've been there a number of times and we've always liked out food.  I've also tried the margarita flights (three drinks of various varieties) and it's a great way to try some of their unique drinks.  Plus the food is delicious.  Free on street parking and a small parking lot next door is very helpful.,4
Salad was good . Fresh . Only one scoop of each tho so if you want extra protein etc . Is extra . Was able to feed four for only around 60 bucks not too bad . I like this place wish there was one in Vegas .,4
"It won't be the food that makes this place go out of business. It will be the service. 

Let's start off with the good. The food. Probably the best in Madison by a good margin. Typical dim sum dishes but they are tasty. If you've eaten dim sum in Chicago, or Texas, or CA, you will still be happy. 

Now the bad. The service. It's horrible and if this place ever closes, I wouldn't be surprised if this was the reason. The service is bad. I had to raise my hand multiple times to get attention. I almost wanted to walk into the kitchen to get my own water, and to refill it. I understand it takes for certain dishes, but I don't see an excuse for any dish to come near an hour later from sitting or when you are about to pay. At least a continuous update is acceptable if it's taking too long.",2
"I live around the corner from here and thought me and my daughter would give this place another try as our first visit wasn't so great.. Turns out the second visit wasn't much better. 

I will say the patio is what got me to go there.  The service is disorganized and slow. I ordered the nachos with cheese and salsa. Adding guacamole and sour cream is a add on (3.00) and adding meat is 4.00. We also ordered calamari. 

Nachos came before the drinks and were served with all the ads ons ( that I didn't order ). The drinks came and they were great ! Then came the calamari which was deep fried to a crisp. My daughter who loves calamari actually gagged on her first bite. The salt was intense. 

We waited another 20 minutes before a server came back and told her I would like the bill and I would pay for my drinks, she said sorry brought me the bill without the food on it. I don't usually dictate what I'll pay, however I wasn't paying for that food.

Unless I was simply going for the patio I would never chose to eat here.",1
"Love this place - it's a hit and miss at times though which is disappointing. I'm giving it a 4 star because there's more hits than miss but when you get the miss, it's truly a bummer especially when you order your food TO GO and get super excited to eat your lunch to discover your food ain't all that yummy just really sucks! Especially since it takes me 30 minutes round trip just to get my TO GO lunch. I just wished they're more consistent. Please pay attention to small details - when you order Katsu, please make sure the breading of the Katsu isn't burnt or  stale and the sauce is in the TO GO bag...the simple things.",4
"I can't sing higher praises of these guys.  My 30k mile Versa had developed an idling problem.  I took my car in for routine maintenance and asked if they would have a look at the problem.  They performed the routine maintenance I requested and although I was a little bit taken aback by the price for the inspection ($100-$200 based on what they had to do) I have trusted them for quality service on other vehicles.  They did a diagnostic and the problem was a misfire on cylinder 2.  They went out of their way to call my dealership to see if the problem was covered under warranty, which it was.  As it turned out Nissan had to replace my engine.  This mechanic could have chased the problem from sensor to sensor and fuel filter and ignition etc etc but they didn't, they found the correct path for me to save money and get my car running perfect again.  After that Matt who is the friendliest and most helpful person you will EVER meet at a mechanic offered to take my car to the dealership and pick it up for me, free of charge.  He even knocked off most of the inspection charge because they quickly realized they wouldn't be doing the work to repair it.  There are cheaper mechanics out there but the quality of service here not only made my experience much better but ended up saving me potentially thousands of dollars worth of repairs that were ultimately covered under my warranty.

Although there is a small premium to get work done here (there are shady mechanics that will do jobs for less) the customer service by itself, let alone the quality of work, honesty and integrity of the staff are well worth the marginal pricing differences.  

Keep up the good work!  Always glad to support local businesses!",4
"I always wanted to try a blowout service but always felt like I would be cheating on my hairstylist. However, after long debate and still having to wait 2 more weeks to see my fantastic stylist (see Volume Beauty Bar) I thought I would go after work and check it out. 
The excitement fell short the moment I walked in the door. The space is kind of funky but the service I received was horrid.

There was no one at the front desk, so I walked into the other side (which was an open doorway into a lash lounge) there was a woman there that I approached.
 
""Hello, I am here for my 5:30 appointment!"" I say with a chipper voice
""what? For lashes, you aren't in the system"" Woman replies 
""oh no sorry, for a blowout!"" I'm using a confused tone...
""I'll be with you in a moment, go sit"" she says shortly

After not long, she comes over and says come with me to the sink and place your stuff here (points at the ground near a mirror)
I go and sit in the chair... she asks if I been to Blo before, I said no but I always wanted to try it out... then she says: yeah awesome and starts to run the water... I tell her that I have colour treated hair and would it be possible to use a shampoo/conditioner that helps preserve colour? She says ""we have MANY clients.... have you ever been to blo before?"" (Um... did you not just ask me that?) And continues to shampoo my hair with whatever was there before my arrival for I'm not kidding 15 seconds then wraps my head in a towel... I say ""no conditioner?"" she says ""Oh I forgot."" And throws some on (no massaging, nothing) for 10 seconds and rinses out.

On the website there were so many styles to choose from but I didn't get to choose, she just said ""blow out, flipping out the ends?"" I say Sure.
She then asks me why I'm there and then asks if I'm going out for the night... when I say no she puts NO product in my hair at all, (no heat protection, no hair spray... nothing) and then just blow dries my hair... there was also no barbicide I could see.

I have to say the end style was ok, it looked like I did it myself without any product. The service and lack of any professionalism/hair care was appalling to me. I will never ever go back.",1
"Very happy with the service offered. I came in to have all of my windows re-tinted because the dealership would not go dark enough. The job was amazing,  but what makes Precision stand out is there dedication. The front windshield was also tinted, but unfortunately it caused to much glare due to the angle of my window. I went back to the shop and the owner offered to remove it and add a tint strip right there and then. The fact that they are family owned and operated brings a certain vibe that is missing in most shops. Thank you for standing behind your product and service.",5
"Great place, great prices. My husband sat on a Drexel sofa in here one day. He talked about it for a week. I told him we had to go back and get it because no man thinks this much about sofa's. We love our sofa. They have awesome mid-century mod furniture in this place and it's solid quality. If anything visit for the company. The owners are fun, they will sit in one of the living room set-ups with you and talk life. Totally worth a visit if you are looking for new furniture.",5
Came for lunch with my friend. We sat at the bar and ordered the blackened fish tacos and shared a side of black beans. Both entrees were DELICIOUS. The beans were spicy and were so tasty and the fish tacos tasted fresh and light. I ordered a Bloody Mary and our bartender made it spicy for me. It was definitely the best Bloody Mary I have ever tasted. Next time I'm in town I will most likely be back.,5
"Garbanzo is a tasty, fresh Mediterranean place that has a variety of items for your wrap, pits or bowl. The prices are reasonable at $8-$10 for a big entree.

It seems that I am timid around Mediterranean food and I just got a chicken pita with lettuce, onions and garlic sauce.  I also got fresh potato chips. I saved the pits for the next day in the fridge and it was great. The chicken had a good grill taste.  The chips were tasty too. 

I probably wouldn't come back here by myself as I don't care for a lot of the toppings, but they look great and the girlfriend enjoyed her loaded up pita.",4
"I'm giving this hotel three stars because the rooms are really nice, clean and comfortable. But the hotel employees have terrible attitudes, especially at the tables. They're so rude and makes the experience crapy. The buffet is okay, not bad and not good. But the price is reasonable. My husband and i have stayed here many times before. I enjoy the cheaper rooms but wish the employees were much nicer.",3
"Love love love this place.
The staff is very friendly and the food ....
I will honestly say I rarely finish my meal , and this is one of the very few places I want to lick the plate. 
Food is always fresh , they even put caviar on your breakfast eggs ?? 
The freshly squeezed OJ mimosas are delicious. 

I highly recommend this place",5
Their gyros are my favorite! Kabobs are delicious and well seasoned too. Kids love their chicken tenders. They never fail to satisfy our Mediterranean food cravings!,5
First time eating here very tasty food. Tried the 117. Drunken Noodle awesome my wife had the 120. Kao Pad she loved it! me 2 :)  Thanks see you soon.,5
"Server was excited about her job. Very friendly and outgoing and loves the food here. The atmosphere is s bit odd....the main bar area is still the same as the previous restaurant ... Dark and dreary with uncomfortable booths ... Seats are broken down....the main restaurant area has some nice features and then some ugly features. Nothing works together....old glass tile from previous restaurant with etched glass inserts, cow hid booths and wood tables feel like old west, graffiti wall and long bar table feel like LA, industrial look, haunted house feel lighting and tables and chairs. Just crazy combinations. Could've used an experts touch! 
Food- the beet salad was AMAZING!! The shrimp ceviche was great .. Chia that it's served with are AWESOME. Fish and chips good... Not a fan of the ""fancy sauce"" and fries nothing great. Burger was ok also had ""fancy suace"" definitely not a fan. The homemade ketchup too runny don't recommend. 
Overall we will be back hopefully they make a few changes. Staff very attentive and friendly.",4
"I am now a regular, mostly out of convenience. I visit every 1.5 months or so. Their deal for regular mani & pedi is still one of the best in town, $38.
During my visits, I also see other regulars chatting with the technicians. It's a nice atmosphere and they do keep it fairly clean. The pedicure chairs can be temperamental with the remote control. 
Bring cash if you can.",4
"By far my favorite restaurant! Perfect service- beyond amazing food- every time I come! Better food and service than any restaurant I have ate at in NYC or Chicago. 

Happy to see the places packed- they deserve it!",5
"First timer here!
Holy shit does your service suck!

Not only did your idiot server not understand, ""double vodka with a shot of olive juice and then add some olives""

Her response, ""oh thats like #6939845""

No. I want a double vodka with olive juice and olives. Its like a martini without ice.

What am i served? A martini, by a white jacketed lady, not the forearm two-tatted amoebic idiot who f'd up the order. Ok fine. Not what I wanted but it will do.

What will not do and is not fine- ignoring me as you ask the rest of the table about food, second drinks and taking away empties. 

And $13 for ceviche with 3 pieces of fish is robbery. Tasty but wallet rape robbery.

I would have said this but hey, ignored! And ps overenthusiastic douche, glad our 'man' figured out the tab for you-trim your happy by 30% 'cause its annoying as fuck.

Enjoy your measly 18% tip.

Your customer service needs work.
Sincerely - a chronic over tipper so your ass really sucks!!",1
Been here many many times while staying at the Hard Rock always great fresh tasting food. First time ever  stopped in for happy hour today. Ordered the HH tacos. BIG MISTAKE! These were simply deep fried frozen tacos with some lettuce and salsa thrown on top. Didn't finish one of the two. Grease dripping down my hand. Just terrible.,1
"I just got my car detailed, 3 years after purchasing it. It smelled and looked like new. I got the interior detail since I always have kids in the car. It was worth what I paid. Definitely will come back!! They don't push you to do more. They also gave me a detailed tour of what they did and what was included in the interior detail package. They are always busy, but their work shows why.",5
I like that they dont make you use the stupid discount cards. But i saw something gross today. They had individual carrot cake servings that were out on the rack. When I mentioned the bakery girl that carrot cake with cream cheese frosting needs to be refrigerated she said no it's fine. Too bad they don't teach them the right things at food handling school these days.,3
"We went early today to avoid any possible rush. Greeted nicely and seated right away. Immediate service with drinks being brought straight away. At this point my mate says; dark in here. The wait person came to take our order. Tonight we had Cory as our server, a very upbeat helpful person providing good service. We order our dinners plus soup. We both liked our soup, I enjoyed my main plate of ribs, my mate did not like his thinking; where is the Cajun in the steak. The steak it self was tender and cooked as requested. Just no discernable flavour. Even though I enjoyed my food I have a feeling we will not be going back. In the middle of the meal they turn down the lights and turn up the music. The music was just fine, why try to drown out conversation? I also might suggest that someone, everyone clean the front door where people put there fingers, it is grimy from long periods of not being cleaned. Also much closer to the diner is the shades on the windows they are absolutely disgusting with grime. I doubt they have ever been cleaned.",3
"I have been to Lupo many times over the years, and my most recent visit reminded me why I should return as often as possible.  My favorite dish is Lasagna ""Della Nonna"" made with spinach pasta, bolognese, and bechamel sauce - true comfort food, but the menu and specials offer many options, both elegant and more traditional, all made with Wolfgang Puck's attention to detail.  The burrata appetizer and shrimp scampi appetizer's were delicious.  A surprise addition to the menu was the pistachio souffle with white chocolate gelato for dessert - unbelievably fluffy and tasty.  Making the dinner truly special was the impeccable service provided by Allen and the waitstaff.  I suggest making a reservation through OpenTable.
Allen made our dinner this past Saturday very enjoyable.  The best food in the world is nothing without good service.  His professionalism was refreshing in this age of carelessness.",5
"With a name like La Comida you'd think I would have at least eaten a taco or something, but nope this was purely a drink and dash mission. 

La Comida has an amazing look from the bar to the dining room, which are all in the same area. I met up with my family here after dinner as they had suggested La Comida for a few drinks before heading out into downtown. I bellied up to the bar and took a look at the margarita menu. I'm not a huge tequila fan so I asked the bartender what her favorite drink was on the menu? ""El Corral"", she replied. Well saddle up partner...let's do this. 

The ""El Corral""  margarita comes with Anejo Tequila, sour mix & Grand Marnier. The drink was refreshing at first and not over powering with the tequila, however, with every sip the drink got sweeter and sweeter. I actually didn't even finish the whole drink, I passed the rest to my GF and ordered a whiskey based margarita. Mmmm, this was super tasty and very interesting. A little Jameson, soda water and a splash of sweet & sour mix. Not on the menu, but if you sweet talk Tanya she might make one for ya. I did try my cousin's drink, the Tamarind margarita, and I liked this one a little bit than my original drink. More salty than sweet.  I'll get you next Tamarind...next time. Muahahahah

I did eat chips and salsa while I was here and I looovvveee me some chips and salsa. The offerings at La Comida are above and beyond. I ordered the Roma Tomato and Habanero salsa which definitely had a kick, but nothing too strong for the palate. I loved this and could have possibly eaten the whole bowl by myself. 

My time in La Comida was brief, but delightful. The younger local ambience was a nice department from the touristy Strip area and sometimes sterile surroundings of Henderson. To quote the Terminator, ""I'll be back!""",4
Good music. Good food. Good staff. Yellowtail appetizer is amazing and prices are fair.,5
"3.5. Ambiance is a little bright, would be lovely for a lunch! Chairs are no comfortable. But the service was impeccable and patient. Had Biffs red wine, the house line. It's bright and cheerful red that pairs well with everything on the menu we sampled: grilled pickerel bannocko. Which were outstanding- fish roe, a delicate but zesty sauce, and just fried enough fish. I highly recommend. Then the turkey burger - meh, it didn't blow me away, it was fine, no real stand out qualities. The beef cheek pot roast with grits on the other hand was perfectly made. A amazing dish, braised and then roasted. Melt in your mouth meat. But the grits were frothy and flavored just enough with a buttery undertone. Just so so s'more dessert. But I don't like dessert. So go for it, it's dense brownie, not too sugary and has a touch of whimsy as its top with heavily charred marshmallows.",3
"The store is wonderful. It's the groomers that I'm reviewing. I have had 2 terrible run ins with snippity know-it all girls. If you want to be ignored and huffed at, or be bitched at for not bringing in your dog more often, this is the groomers for you.",1
"This restaurant is one of my favourite Japanese place. The ramen is amazing and all the subtle hints of flavour added to every meal makes them come alive. By the way, you must try the chicken karagge with wasabi mayo on the side. Great sake selection",5
"Hands down best ever!!! Both steak and chicken Sammys are AMAZING. 
Sits inside a Sinclair gas station at the corner of pecos and Patrick.  Made to order so takes a couple of minutes. The fries are also amazing. The fries are in a paper bag so no styrofoam ( soggy fries) you could eat this two/three times a week easily!
Go now",5
"Like the vibe in this place, seems like your really in Japan grinding down on some good sushi. I always come back. Friendly staff always a plus.",5
This is it never again will i go to subway. Jersey Mikes has happy trained staff and there for is fresh and delicious every time. I went into this subway today to get a simple salad. I said hello to the young lady behind the counter and i barley got a response. I then asked her what kind of salad do you have and she just shrug your shoulders and said I don't know. Then a teen age boy with a horrible attitude walked in. Neither one of these kids wanted to be there that was easy to see and feel. I asked the boy how was the spinach and with an attitude he said it looks like spinach. I said look smart mouth i wanted know what the quality was. I got my pitiful ugly disgusting salad for $9 what a rip off. But as bad as the food is its nothing compared to the horrible customer service. Please Jersey Mikes come to Anthem,1
"Had the pleasure of being greeting by Ms. Dutch. Warm and friendly and was very knowledgeable of the Swarvorski products. I got 3 great pieces, so go by and see Ms Dutch she will take good care of you!",5
"I love to try new sub shops and Mt. Lebo subs did not disappoint. We ordered the turkey and cheese and Mt. Lebo sub for take out and it was ready in 20 min. I wasn't all that impressed with the potato and macaroni salad, but that's just based on my taste preferences. Otherwise, very good and reasonably priced for the quality.",5
"Review for Liz, piercer. I have not dealt with anyone else nor have I had any other work done here.... yet?

Liz is abfab. She did 6 intimate piercings for me (4, then 2 more, about a month apart) and made the experience memorable (is that a ""duh"" statement?), easy to handle, and totally doable. I was hesitant, for sure, but Liz put me at ease right away!

She is knowledgable, personable, and beyond safe. I have never met anyone so careful, clean, and concerned for her work. She explains what she is doing and why, and how something is used and why it is important. She is careful to keep you part of the experience and does not rush you through anything.

I went back to her for one re-do (not at all a reflection on her work) and one replacement ring (months later, no re-do needed). She is always easy to work with and maintains a high-level of professionalism without being stand-offish or cold in any way.

Liz is amazing and I can't wait to see her for more body jewelry!

-------------

As for the shop in general? Everyone has always been great to me. I can't name anyone specifically, but I have been in here many time to look at tattoos (either for me or friends) and everyone has been helpful, friendly, and ready to get us working. I look forward to checking them out further.",5
"Stopped in tonight for a couple little things, used a card to pay and less than 2 hours later my card account balance was zeroed out at a Walmart super center in Texas!!! Thankfully I have alerts to my account activity and caught it quick. I'll NEVER RETURN TO THIS STORE. BEWARE!!!",1
"This is exactly what I needed today around noon, when the snow was falling, and I was only mid-route (I'm a dog walker). 

This is quite honestly the *best* americano I'd ever had.

I'm a regular at a few different coffee shops in the King West area, but I'm changing my daily route, and going one block out of my way, just so I can grab a coffee at this place!

As everyone has already mentioned, The Slayer is a beautiful and stunning machine. You can't help but notice is when you walk in the door.

The place is very casual, and doesn't have crap all over the walls. It's clean and airy, but still maintains that warm feeling you'd want your local coffee place to have. 

The 2 guys working there (who I think both own he place) are cool guys. 
I just happen to chat about my dog walking business, and one of the owners has a couple of dogs!",5
"Showed up at 2:00, all but three tables were covered with trash and only 20% were occupied. Turned around and left in disguise. Not eating at an establishment where they don't bother cleaning up their tables, especially when it is not busy. They deserve their one star reviews.",1
"I went here twice because it was in the hotel I was staying in (Westin). I was pretty excited that I had a great bar in the hotel so as to avoid having to drive or walk far. 

It's a nice looking restaurant/bar. I sat at the bar so I don't know what the rest of the place looks like. The service here was really good. I didn't have a single problem. 

First night I ordered the bacon and cheddar burger with a pretzel bun. I was skeptical of the bun thinking it was some sort of gimmick, but it was really good! The burger, I ordered it medium rare, came out rare, but I'd rather go that way than the other. The only big problem with this burger is that the onion rings I ordered to go on top of it were red onions. Red onions are not sweet, they are very bland and in turn really bring the taste of the burger way down. I like the sweetness of white/yellow onions. These were not that. I couldn't even eat them, they were gross. 

The second night I was there I ordered the same thing because it really was a great burger. I asked this time if they could make my burger actually medium rare since it was so rare last time. The bartender recommended I order it medium and then it would come out medium rare (you'd think), but it actually came out medium. Uh. They brought me my new burger out and it was fine, but I was irked by the insistence of the person who brought it to immediately cut into it (which I don't, I eat it as a whole burger) to see if it was okay. That was not okay, the burger was. 

I then ordered a dessert that I waffled on. I really wanted the pop tart but then waiter told me it was really small. I then ordered my other choice, the red velvet birthday cake. They should REALLY have a disclaimer that their cake is NOT made in-house. If I want boxed cake I don't need to pay $6 a slice, I can walk to the grocery store and get a whole cake for that. I don't go to restaurants to have boxed dessert, I just don't. This and the onion rings were why it gets this many stars. 

The service is excellent, the bartender that waited on me both times was very nice and the food could be great with a few modifications. I won't be back, but it was an okay place to have dinner a couple of times.",3
"Great food tried a couple of things from their menu , green and yellow curry which was good tried pat sue very good and spring rolls and thai tea was really good not very happy with there pad thai could be improved ...overall fast service good place to dine or order take out",4
I had all FOUR wisdom teeth pulled today! !! I was super nervous after hearing about my friends experiences. Cindy and the rest of the staff was very reassuring. Every one from the assistants to the surgeon made me feel very comfortable and relaxed. The procedure was very fast which I loved. The surgeon communicated with me the whole time which helped a lot. I really like how they take payments too. I would definitely recommend a friend to this place.  You guys did that Westwind! !,4
"Standard Chinese buffet fare...decent selection of options.  General Tso's buffet rule #1 - don't get pieces you have to cut smaller, or you will see what you're eating.  Bland desserts, but for $5, what more can you ask for?",3
"Was looking forward to a good dinner for the wifes bday. She placed the order 50 minutes before the scheduled pick up. Still had to wait 25 minutes more once I got there. The customer service, or lack there of sucked. It was good food, but won't return to this one because of the service.",1
"This refrigeration company is great. We've been using them since 2003 for installation of a new unit, routine maintenance and occasional repairs. They always respond quickly, show up and take care of the problem. No hype, no drama, no surprises, exactly what you want from a business. Fully recommend them to anyone.",5
"Authentic, tasty & expertly prepared food, this pretty much sums up our meal at Haji Baba. 
We decided to have lunch here after reading the glowing reviews for this place on yelp. At first glance, it looked like any other store in a strip mall but inside, it is divided into a store front & a restaurant. The space is clean & the service is excellent/attentive. 

our lunch consisted of a vegetarian combo plate(falafel x2, baba ganouj, tabbouleh, grape leaves x2) shish kabob plate(lamb kabob x5 pieces,rice, lettuce salad with tahini,1 Arabic bread) side of labni( kind of cream cheese), ful mudammas (mix of beans in a flavored curry sauce)- yes we were really hungry :)
In the veggie combo- The falafel was crispy, freshly made & grape leaves were unlike any I have eaten. The ful mudammas was tasty, well prepared/flavored without being spicy. In case of the shish kabob plate- the lamb was well cooked (I asked for medium done meat & that's what I was served) but it was bland. The portions are huge but prices are reasonable . 
Don't miss picking up some yummy middle eastern desserts from the store, to finish up your meal.  
We left Haji Baba, stuffed/content & with lotsa doggie bags!",4
"Oysters from the gulf. Yumm .. Taste like BP.

Just kidding. The oysters were fine and fresh. 
I like the energy in this tavern. The folks are upbeat and friendly. 
Just the place to be for a relaxing evening with a few beers and watch some sports on TV. They'll take good care of you and you can zone out in front of the TV for an hour or so over dinner.

I had 3 types of their tacos and I remember their fish tacos and chicken tacos were very good. The shrimp taco was so-so. 

I'll be back for more.",4
"We had the lunch buffet on Sunday and well worth the $11.99. Loved the Curry chicken and the tikka masala chicken , the garlic naan is so soft and flavorful. Love this place, great food and great customer service!",5
"Had Jason's catered into a class we were in for two days this week and their food was so good!
So we decided to come to Jason's for breakfast / lunch with our kids and its even better in person! Manager greeted us at the door went over menu options. Great prices and portions. I ordered a Ruben 1/2 portion and it came with an option of side salad or soup, I got the salad and I was able to build it myself at the salad bar, which by the way has a wide array of options you don't see at salad bars anymore. Fresh produce! To top it off, you get free ice cream sundaes build your own!!!! Can't wait to come back, the kids loved it.",5
"Where do we even start with Classic Cakes?  First, meeting and working with Ella was very fun.  During our initial tasting, the decision of what to pick was hard because it was all delicious.  It was seriously the best cake we had ever had.  As we narrowed our choices to the top few, Ella gave her opinion on what combinations go well together.  We were very happy with our selection on our wedding day and we were blown away with how beautiful the cake turned out!  Fast forward to our 1 year anniversary...  What would the celebration be without another cake from Classic Cakes?  We had Ella replicate the top layer of our cake!  Once again, it was delicious!  Ella truly is a talented artist, and her cakes, a tasteful masterpiece!",5
"When I strolled into this joint with my pockets bulging with Mandalay Bay chips I expected to be completely blown away. The place is nicely designed and of course has the usual eye-candy-ish host staff at the front desk that you learn to expect at these fancy schmancy type places. The young blond hottie proceeded to seat me right next to another couple who were dressed to impress while I was looking slightly better than alley trash. My first thought was to ask to move, but then I decided that since I might get bored at any moment that I would just sit there and eavesdrop on their conversation. 

When I gamble I usually either GO BIG, or play really conservative, so I decided to treat this meal the same way. I pulled out a quarter and gave it a flip. Tails for cheap. Alright the theme has been set. Instead of ordering the $180 wagyu 8oz steak I opted for the 16? 18? oz $51bone-in rib-eye. For a side-dish I chose the ""caramelized onion and goat cheese scalloped potatoes"" which came in at like $13 or $14. I also ordered WATER. Bottled water sir? No, just regular water please. Oh and with the steak please bring me an $18 a glass of this cheap Cabernet. Would you like an appetizer to start off with sir? No. A salad or some crab-cakes? No thanks. I'm not really starving right now so I can wait. 

So as the waiter rushes off I proceed to listen to the life-stories of this couple I was seated next to and waited for my food. Ahem, Sir the chef sent you this complimentary fries, three different types of fries, each paired with its own special dip. Actually these fries were pretty good, but if you go here, I wouldn't spend 9 bucks for them, just wait for them to get comped. 

Anyhow, the steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, but it had a little more fat and bone than I would have liked. The scalloped potatoes were excellent. A little rich for some people I would suspect but good for me. 
While savoring the taste of the rib-eye, a thought occurred to me: When I cook rib-eyes over mesquite wood at home on my BBQ after seasoning them properly, they taste almost exactly like this. Ahh well, probably just overestimating my own potential again. 

To give this place a fair review I would probably have to kick out more cash than the $94 bucks I spent here. It was good. It is probably a great place to take a date to impress or the wife/girlfriend/mistress for some special occasion.  I guess you are paying for the ambiance.  It was good and I'll probably end up here again after pillaging the Mandalay blackjack tables, but not overly impressive, at least with the cheap stuff I ordered.",3
"I don't mind paying for premium products but this place is a little to over priced. 

The one thing good about this place is that you can go and look and feel how products will be before you order it online or finding a better deal at another place.

It's well kept and in order, and the staff here are friendly as well.",3
One of my favorite spots.  The mango tango margarita is the bomb!  I usually sit at the bar because Joe gives the best service.  The short rib taco is also amazing.  Definitely try this place.,5
"I needed a new system drive SSD installed, the O/S restored on the new SSD and the old SSD cleared of the O/S and added to my storage drives. That was done. 

The rest noted on a detailed sheet was not: All drives changed to GPT, and System Reserve moved from HD RAID 0 to SSD via disconnecting non-system drives and running win repair. I complained to the Manager and he had the Geek, Jose, call me and vigerously argue that GPT can not be put on a drive below 2.2T.

No way Jose, Just because MBR has an upper limit does not mean GPT has a lower limit. MBR on less than 2T is convention not a technology limit of GPT.

I had to make the changes myself. 

That one cost me a near $500.00",1
"I have never been more disappointed in my gastronomic experience in Urbana-Champaign then this past weekend at Destihl ""Brewery"" (who knows if they even brew beer at this place). Having been to Destihl a handful of times before the abominable brunch I suffered through this past weekend I expected an experience somewhat similar to what most people describe here on Yelp. That being a friendly staff, and decent (perhaps even good) food at reasonable prices. 

Unfortunately, Destihl has suffered a complete drain of quality over the last few years. When it opened, Destihl offered hot, quality food served my intellectual and friendly servers who were happy to be working in one of Champaign's better restaurants. Each time I dined at Destihl I noticed the quality of the food, the quality of the service, and the quality of the dining experience was eroding away. This erosion culminated with the brunch a group of friends and I endured this past Sunday. 

I say endured because our meal lasted from 12:30p.m. until 2p.m. The absurd elongation of our meal was not caused by entrancing, deep conversation amongst old friends, or by laggard mastication of our fantastic food. The epoch that was our brunch at Destihl was caused solely by the complete ineptitude and incompetence of our server, the manager, and Destihl as an establishment. 

To begin, our waiter spoke to our group at a volume slightly above ""whisper"". He seemed to not care at all that our decently sized group would likely give him his biggest tip of the day. One could almost assume our waiter was indentured to Destihl and taking our orders, suggesting menu items, and assuring that we were taken care of was a reminder of the chains that confined him. After taking our orders, three of which were simply ""eggs, bacon, and potatoes"" (not worth the $10), our group set off on the marathon that ninety minutes later would end in us getting our food. 

In total our group would watch at least seven other parties wait for a table, be placed near us, taken care of by the same subjugated waiter, eat, pay their bill, and depart. After the fourth group who had arrived after us was served before us, a member of our group called the manager over. At this point we had spent 45 minutes ordering and waiting. 

By this point the waiter had been unable to provide any information about our meal besides, ""they are still working on it, should be out soon."" This information was decrypted by the members of our group through the reading of his lips and not by any sort of audible understanding between him and ourselves. We hoped the manger could provide us with additional information, this would prove to be a fool hearted assumption.

The manager assured us he would check on our order and would return shortly. After three more groups consumed their meals, paid their tabs and departed, and another half an hour passed, the manager had not returned. At this point our group decided that if our food did not arrive by 1:45 PM. we would simply stand up, leave, and eat fast food. 

Finally, at 1:43p.m., 1 hour 13 minutes after arriving our meal was served. Destihl was relatively empty when we arrived and continued to be throughout our meal. Yet, our food took longer to cook than the run time of the original 1931 version of Frankenstein. If you have been to Destihl for brunch you know none of the menu items are difficult to cook, they are largely egg dishes accompanied by breakfast meats, french toasts, or a hot sandwich. Since this experience ended I have wondered what took so long for our food to be cooked and leave the kitchen. 

I have surmised that the reasons for our hour and a half endeavor are a product of the poor quality that now defines Destihl. First, our waiter did not care about us nor did he serve as our representative in the kitchen. Second, the cooks clearly lost track of our order because some food came out steaming hot, some came out only partially complete, and the rest came out lukewarm (presumably having spent an hour under a heat lamp). Finally, the manager who never returned to our table and only after being called over again offered excuse after excuse before finally saying, ""Well, I am sorry.""

To anyone who has invested the time to read my review, thank you. To anyone who has spent the time to read my review and still intends to go to Destihl even after I have made clear my utter frustration and disappointment, I wish you the best of luck. 

To conclude, my friends and I will never eat at Destihl again and I look forward to the restaurant that will soon replace it.",1
"I would be interested in hearing from others who have had this product on for a couple of years.  

We had our granite tops, grout, glass and fixtures done about 2 1/2 years ago, and the fixtures and glass seem to be like they were never done.  The cleaning people are now asking to use CLR to clean the shower doors.  Over all, not impressed.  I THINK if we had used the expensive, proprietary cleaning product, we may have been better off, but we used the most neutral cleaners we felt did the job of cleaning and sanitizing, and the product didn't seem to hold up.  The grout is just about to need professional cleaning.  Too bad",3
"Outstanding customer service.  With all the samples coming to my house, the whole process from start to finish took about an hour.  After ordering it was installed in a week.  Highly recommended.",5
"Cagibi is SO over-rated.

OK I love the look of the place (they get 2 stars for that), I like how it's all cosy, it makes me feel at home (which is like 2 meters away...)  But there's nothing special about their menu. If at least the coffee was good I would totally join the local hipsters with my mac book pro. But yeah, no. Nothing special about the food too, there are better vegetarian food in the neighborhood. And I find it expensive for what it is.

So hey what's the point?",2
"The BEST falafel I have ever had, and I have had some good falafel! The hummus, as you can imagine, is amazing. Good creamy texture and lots of different flavors. Had the jalapeño hummus which was delicious but not as spicy as I had hoped. Aleeta (spelling?) was warm and welcoming, great service! 

The atmosphere is more upscale than I expected. I was thinking this would be a casual dining experience. I was thinking a little more ""fast casual dining"" but this has more of a restaurant feel. I would recommend this place for a business meeting.",5
"I came out to Vegas for my friends bachelorette party and stayed here and oh my  This hotel is the worse. It smells the toilet over flowed , the staff is a little rude. We had to wait 3 hours for check in when they promised us a certain time talking about they short staff. The water heater was leaking and it ruined my clothes shoes and bag. The breakfast buffet was not so good. The eggs were powdered. The French toast was hard as ever. For the cost I could have went somewhere else. The upside to it the endless mimosas was very good. That's the only reason why I gave it a two star. If this and motel 6 was the last available room in Vegas I would stay at motel 6",2
"Our table had the steak frites, Ohio lamb bolognese and the boar pizza and they were all excellent. Flip Side is connected to the restaurant and you can also order from their beer list as well. We made a reservation on Open Table. I'll be back!",4

"I'm from Charleston SC, and I've been looking for a place like this since I got here a year ago.. I was soooo ecstatic!! The customer service was super!! Not to mention a very clean establishment.. I ordered the Spicy Sonoma Caesar, my tastebuds were very pleased. I would definitely return and recommend to other.. Long story short I was a happy camper!!  :)",5
Planet Dailies is a great place to dine anytime 24/7. It is conveniently located inside Planet Hollywood. I recommend the blacken chicken or the shrimp pasta for your delightful meal. The server Pierre V provided amazing customer service. I will definitely return again with family and friends.,4
"Being new to the city, I went to Aroma upon the recommendation of a friend (who later told me she stopped going there). I decided to make use of the 15% discount on Tues/Weds and went in for a brazilian ""clean as a whistle"" wax. With the discount, it came out to $35 + tip.

I read on yelp about the efficiency of the place and how quick they are, but I felt like I was part of a production line. I knew I was going to be late for my appointment, so I called in ahead of time to inform them of such. First I thought I was being rushed because I was late, and offered to wait until there was a gap but I was assured it was fine. 

The whole experience was about 6 minutes long. Before I even knew what happened, I was told it was done, and to wipe myself down with the oil for any sticky spots. This was new to me as my past experiences have been full service where they make sure to wipe you down and ensure no wax residue or hair is left behind. All this at a lower price tag.

I walked out of there far from being clean as a whistle. In my 9 years of getting brazilian waxes, this was the least thorough wax done. There were patches left behind, and the butt cheeks weren't even touched. 

Maybe it depends on the technician, but I was very disappointed and will not be returning here.",2
"I am a big fan of Cozumel's at Independence and Broadview Hts.  On this occasion, there must have been a language barrier but I received a Modelo in the bottle when I specifically mentioned I wanted Model draft in 16oz size.  Not the end of the world but two of us had fajitas.  They must have burnt a whole batch because both of ours were heaping portions filled with mostly meat that had a burnt aftertaste.  We could hardly eat it and the server was shocked when we didn't want doggy bags.  I wouldn't feed that to my dogs!  Maybe just an off night but you just can't serve people food you wouldn't serve to friends and family!",2
"For fans of Basik Cafe or the Hawaiian acai bowls, this is the place to come. Great selection, plus ability to add extra toppings. My favorite is the North Shore bowl with added cocoa nibs and bee pollen. Perfect for a hot day",5
"I don't know what other people purchased or sampled, but I was VERY impressed with the product I sampled which was the Venofye Viperlift Bio Syringe.
First the rep, Danielle, applied it to my husbands eyes. After about one minute his eye area looked beyond amazing. 
The price was a bit much, but I know what Botox can cost over the cost of a year, so thanks to Danielle we were able to get the product at a very reasonable price.
However, when I arrived home the syringe didn't work. I was LIVID. I tried calling Danielle, and was unable to reach her on her phone...then I called the Customer service number. This all happened AFTER I read so many negative reviews about this place.
I NEVER should have read those reviews...the customer service people were AMAZING. They said they would ship me a brand new syringe and something extra for my trouble.  
In the meantime, Danielle called me back after seeing she missed my call. I explained what happened and SHE immediately called customer service on my behalf to make sure the product shipped ASAP.
The next day Danielle provided me with the tracking number and my new product was delivered the day after that. The new syringe works perfectly and I couldn't be happier with the results for both my husband and myself.
Now that I have the product at home, I've used it on my ""11's"" and other areas with wrinkles that typically can only be helped with Botox or Restylane. I cannot praise this product enough. It's like a miracle in a bottle! 
As long as this keeps working I'll continue to be a customer.",5

While I usually see Sonya, all the stylists are great and they all back each other up when necessary.   It is a great value, they run on time and they are all very professional.  I've been a ""regular"" here for more than 6 years and come every three weeks for color, cuts as needed and regular keratin treatments.   I am always happy with the services I receive.  They care about their customers and do everything they can do to ensure I walk out happy.  I am more than a bit surprised to read some of the negative reviews.   They just don't reflect my experiences there.   Give it a try!    You will not be disappointed.",5
"We were in Vegas for New Year's weekend and were so happy that Nannies & Housekeepers USA was able to accomodate our request for a sitter on short notice.  This agency is very professional.  They called and emailed to confirm the time for the sitter to arrive and even offered to provide a resume for our sitter in advance.  

We have a very active two-year old daughter and we were nervous about leaving her with a sitter, but Madeline was FANTASTIC.  We definitely will request her again the next time we are in Vegas.  She was sitting down and reading a book with our daughter within a few minutes of arriving at our hotel room.  We were out on the town for about 4 hours and came back to find our daughter fast asleep.  She had a great time with Madeline.",5
"The service on entry didn't seem too friendly and almost cold but it was something that really didn't phase me. I walked upto the front placed my order and waited for what seemed quick for a large pizza. Got a discount from the cashier who was very pleasant.

"You may stop at this place for the beer or the live music or the great staff BUT do the planet a favor and try the ""Superhuman Bowl"".  It is so delicious and stuffed with so many superfoods that I am convinced if the right person ate this thing every day for a week they would come up with the cure for cancer! Could that person be you?? Love this place!",5
Great location. The service was quick and courteous. Plenty of seating inside. The barista helped me figure out the right drink; I had forgotten the name and he knew exactly which one it was by the description. The only reason why I took away a star was that the washroom was closed.,4
Amazing wings at an awesome price! I'm really picky about wings and finally found the perfect Lakewood spot. Definitely a dive bar atmosphere at night which is fine with me. I'll absolutely be back.,5
"This is my favorite park in the Champaign Urbana area! Wonderful playground, picnic area, and a walking/running/skating path that winds through the park. The sculptures are on a rotation, and so usually something new and beautiful. It's a great place to excercise, stroll through a lovely prairie setting, and play with children. For a fun day out, take a kite and a picnic. Lots of open space for both.",4
"My car had shipped cross-country with a relocation company in January.  It arrived with at least $2,500 of body work repair needs.  I heard that Service King was a great choice per a Vegas resident's recommendation and an Acura friendly body shop.  They turned out to be so much more!  After a supplemental estimate was completed, a total of around $4,700 of body work was found to be needed against the pre-existing condition of my car before shipping cross-country.  The relocation company was completely unreliable, unresponsive and then downright unreasonable when we could reach them.  My Service King service advisor, Josh Gnadt, went above and beyond joining calls with the relocation company, keeping me up to speed on a daily basis, and when the relocation company finally caved with paying for all damages he ensured the vehicle's work was done in haste.  The end result is my beautiful Acura TSX that I hardly want to take out of the garage for fear of it being any less stunning.  Thanks so so much to the Service King Falconis guys for helping me through a very trying time and ultimately returning my car to an even better condition than when I shipped out here to Vegas.",5
"Went for the first time this week excited to try a sandwich on Dutch Crunch bread after friends from the Bay Area kept raving about it.  The girl at the counter was very friendly and helped me pick from the huge menu.  I wanted a cold-cut sandwich as opposed to a steak or chicken, and she suggested the Tony Soprano (ham, salami, turkey, provolone, italian dressing).  It was happy hour so I got a free drink and chips.  When they brought out the sandwich my first thought was that it was HUGE...but that didn't stop me from eating the whole darn thing!  :)  That dirty sauce on the bread (which tastes like a twist on tzatziki sauce to me) was awesome.  Looking forward to trying other menu items.  I wish there was closer location to my area in NW Valley, but I'll definitely stop by whenever I make a trip to Ikea or other shopping/events in the area.  I must say that I felt it was a tad over-priced considering it was a  $10 sandwich (which normally does not include the drink and chips), but the people, atmosphere, and taste of that sandwich make it worth the visit, especially during happy hour.  If the price point ever gets much higher though, I might reconsider.",4
"EVERYTHING here is FANTASTIC,,,,BUT THE Towering Sashimi Poki is INSANE!!!!
Also the Baked Lobster Roll and the Baked Scallop Roll are a must try. Not a bad thing on the menu!!!!",5
"Went here for Summerlicious 2013. In a word, this place was horrible but let me give you a few details

Service is terrible. My meal started with my waiter bringing me a warm beer. The time it took for the food to arrive was also incredibly long.

For starter, I got the catfish. It tasted like it was frozen before and they just popped it into the deep fryer before serving it to me. 

For the main course, I got the Chicken and Waffles, which for some unknown reason is ranked #2 on BlogTo. This was the worst fried chicken I've had in my life. Popeye's and KFC are both MUCH tastier than this. Chicken was dry and had no flavor or seasoning at all. And for the Waffles they used AUNT JEMIMA maple syrup (I saw them pour it) which baffled me. How can they be charging so much and serving food like this?
I cannot believe BlogTO ranked this Chicken and Waffles above the Drake Hotel's chicken and waffles even though that dish is ten billion times better. 

For dessert, I got the Almond chocolate kisses, which were all in a big Pizza box. The waiter simply took one out of the pizza box, put it on a plate and served it to me. I was so dissapointed with this meal.

This place basically serves expensive Cafeteria food. Avoid at all costs.",1
"Just opened on the edge of the Ballantyne area is a new Asian Sushi Bar. The restaurant is located behind Bojangles next to Carolina Bistro. We have stopped by a few times and everything has been wonderful. I generally get the Sashimi and the pieces are large and fresh. The sushi rolls are the same large and fresh and their prices are very reasonable compared to others in the area. They also have a Chinese menu and a Teriyaki and Hibachi menu for those who do not like the raw stuff. A friend of mine had the Hibachi and loved it. If you stop by, keep in mind they have just opened and are having the usual growing pains of a new business. One last note, there is no alcohol being served for 30 days due to local regulations. But they will have a full bar soon.
They are open for lunch and dinner 7 days a week!",5
Good burger and large salads.  The daily soups are definitely home-made.,4
"Overall this place is really good. I thoroughly enjoyed their fried rice, potato salad and grilled squid. By far my favorite was their tuna hand roll. For the amount of food they give I was pleasantly surprised when the bill came. They are very reasonably priced. I'll definitely be back.",5
"I had Easter brunch with my wife and daughter, and shortly after leaving all us were sick, we all had the same thing. My daughter called the restaurant and asked if anyone else had a problem and was told we were not the only ones to call and she would have a manager call her back on Monday, never received a call. She called the restaurant again on Tuesday and spoke with a manager who stated no one else had called, and would check on it and call her back, never got a call back. Called the restaurant again, spoke with another manager who said the same thing, total runaround. We will never go back due to the lack of concern by management. Very poor customer service. 

Update as of 1May2017, my daughter and my wife have spoken with the owners wife, who accused my daughter of lying. Nothing has been done to make this right.",1
"Stayed here for 1 night while in Charlotte on business:

Pros:
- Cool building, brand new
- Nicely furnished
- Good bar set up
- Easy parking (valet or parking deck next door)
- Convenient to Uptown restaurants/bars (but may border on dangerous area)

Cons:
- Borderline customer service from the front desk
- Sketchy area

I was really looking forward to staying here due to its location and also that it had a unique design.  Upon checking in I was told that due to being fully booked I had been ""downgraded"" to a room with 2 queen beds vs. a room with a king bed that I had reserved a month prior.  Not the end of the world, but the message could have delivered better and they could have offered something in return (a drink at the bar would have been a nice gesture).  Other interactions with the front desk were just okay.  They could use some customer service training.  So minus 1 star there.

Minus 2 stars for the location.  There is a transit station across the street and I noticed a lot of people loitering.  No big deal in and of itself.  Charlotte is a big city.  However some people may not be comfortable walking through that area.  But from my walk (in daylight) from the hotel to the Uptown restaurant area, I passed at least 6 ARMED security guards outside various business within 2 blocks.  Once I reached a certain point in Uptown, no more security guards.  Hmmmmmmm.  Upon returning, l had to walk past a potential police situation to get to the hotel.  It was going down less than 50 ft. from the hotel lobby.  Basically some teenage (15-18 years old) kids were yelling and trying to intimidate people on the sidewalk.  Cops showed up, 6 of them - THANK YOU MEN AND WOMEN IN BLUE.  The cops were very calm as the punks tried to escalate the situation.  People going in and out of the hotel were very uncomfortable and it was a fairly volatile situation for 15 minutes or so.  Obviously the hotel has no control over what goes on in the streets around them, so it's not their fault but...

Bottom line is you will more than likely be totally safe if you don't walk alone at night around the hotel...typical big city advice.  However, there are a lot of other hotels in different parts of Uptown that are safer and where I wouldn't think twice about walking around by myself at night.  And that's where I'll be staying in the future.",2
Love this Farmers Market!! Although I think they are a bit over priced but that's what you get for living in the middle of a desert!,4
"Great place to find the best bargain on our new mattress, lavender scented memory foam pillows and bamboo sheets! The staff was professional and finally, I will highly recommend this place to my friends!",5
"I was there because I heard my friend saying that there's finally a bubble tea inside UofT! Yeah!!!
But it turns out that I didn't get bubble tea, instead I got the the whole grape fruit juice drink. It is truely refreshing, and very suitable to drink during the hard time study at Robarts library!
My friend said that the signature jasmine green cheesy tea is also very good, so I'm definitely gonna try that for the next time.",5
"I think that Subway is awful and this place is worse.  They have bland sandwiches and then for some reason they squish them.  I guess that is their thing, but it's not good.",1
"WOW ..... Great burgers Great service 
Walked in thinking it was your usual burger joint I was surprised with the friendly service and perfectly cooked burger",5
"Went in for the first time to have my eyebrows waxed and was impressed. The building was very nice, and I was worked with in a private room. Paula who did my eyebrows was pleasant and courteous. She seemed very experienced and did a good job. Before tip and tax it cost $12 which is quite reasonable. I would recommend.",4
"The experience at Flamingo was a good one. Everything went very well. The room was nice and clean with the view at Cezar Palace . The lady at check in was very nice and helpful. The hotel is clean and very well organized . Also it is set up right in the middle of the strip. We ate most of the time at buffet , food was delicious and good. The only thing is you have to stay in line for crapes. It is only one person who is making them and I think she doesn't have enough experience to move fast. Everything else was a good adventure.",5
"All American Grill.  I have been coming here for 3 weeks.. We had a company event here the staff is very attentive, the food is awesome and the drinks are unreal.  I love this place so much and I will recommend it to anyone.",5
"Great place...HUGE menu....maybe read it online before you stroll in...or you will stand there like it's 1995 and you are trying to figure out what movie to rent from Blockbuster. 

All our sandwiches were great. Fries were good, nothing special to me. 

Got really busy towards lunch time, very limited seating. Not a bad thing though! Place is booming.",4
"Wild Wing is normally a 3-4 star restaurant, but this particular location is a disappointment. The place is empty most of the time and although the servers are generally friendly and attentive, the food takes a surprisingly long amount of time and, at my last visit, the wings came out warm, not hot. There was only one other table in the place which makes me wonder if the cook or server left my wings to cool while they did other tasks. It's also a cold atmosphere, both from a decor and temperature perspective. 

I actually felt ashamed eating here. Like everyone has figured out better places, but not me. 

Beer was cold at least.",2
"I am a big big fan of a good piece of pizza...this is some real good pizza. Good sauce, awesome crust. Laid back atmosphere to the restaurant. Good service. Overall I am very pleased with this restaurant.",5
"Pleasant surprise for my downtown lunch!  Nice guys, too!",4
"I've been in Phoenix,AZ for 5 years now. This place has been the best I've tried since I been in here. Very clean on the inside, great atmosphere, great conversation. I got the boneless bbq spear ribs lunch plate and a side order of chicken wings. Definitely will be back for more.",5
"I ate lunch here today. No frills just lots of frys on top of everything including my salad lol not what I was expecting from a salad...The vegetable soup was good and hearty lots of veg. My steak salad was just ok. The meat was well done dry  shaved sandwich like steak with a few tough grizzly un chewable pieces that had to be spit out, on top of iceberg lettuce sliced olives and shredded cheese topped with a mound of frys served in a take out box with plastic fork even though I was dining in. This is a fast food chicken wing & French fry kind of place.",3
"I was impressed as soon as I walked in the door when a guy came over, mentioned he was new and couldn't seat us but just wanted to make sure someone said hi to us. That being said the host showed up promptly and seated us right away. I was there with some friends from abroad that I hadn't seen in a long time so we had a lot of catching up to do. Our server was very accommodating and gave us all the time we needed. It was a long dinner with much chatting before we ordered and after our plates were cleared and our server was available when we needed her but never hovered or rushed us. All restaurants should be like this. The food was great too. I had the meatballs with cornbread and collard greens. The meatballs were fantastic and the cornbread was nice and spicy and served warm. I wish there had been more greens on the plate as I am a believer in a healthy balanced plate and this was almost entirely meat and cornbread. So not the healthiest choice, but this isn't the place you go for healthy food. Overall, a fantastic experience that I will definitely return for.",5
"This will be the 4th time I have been here.  This time, I tried the pork and lemme tell you, it was by far the best pork I have ever had.

But...we also ordered the soup(sweet potato clam bacon). It was amazing,,,except it felt like they split our order with someone else and only gave us a half order.  I kid you not, the soup was only 1/2 inch deep in the bowl.    For $16, it felt like we were really getting ripped off.   It's soup!   Do you really need to be that stingy?

4 people, 2 appetizers, 1 soup, 3 meals(split) no dessert... $240.  A bit expensive imho for this meal.  
    I love a good meal, but there has to be value and this is starting to feel over-priced",3
Very disappointed.  I sent in an inquiry via email and they never responded.  Then I called and left a message - they also never returned my call.  I don't get it --- how can they have good reviews with such terrible communication skills/methods?,1
LOVE THIS PLACE! They are so kind and caring plus my nails have never looked better.,5
This place is amazing! The food and staff are incredible!! The dessert bowl is my favorite!!! Jessica is always so friendly and welcoming as soon as I walk in.,5
"Booked an appointment on Yelp at 4. Get there and there's 3 people still in front of me?! Don't use Booksy if you don't honor the appointments!!! 

Go somewhere else.",1
Love the food but have had multiple orders made wrong. Both when ordered over the phone and in person.,2
"Crash of Rhinos painted our home the week of May 23, 2016. Our experience with this company was phenomenal!  The customer service was second to none!  We received weekly updates prior to commencement of work and daily updates during the work period.  Kim and the office staff were outstanding, answering my questions regarding paint colors and giving opinions when asked.  The actual team represented themselves professionally during the three days they were here. They prepped the house by power washing all surfaces and protected and masked the surfaces well.  Our pool was covered to prevent over spray.  The final product was BEAUTIFUL!  Our house looks brand new!  We would definitely recommend them and will use them in the future.",5
Was hoping for more but got much less French toast was gross . Breakfast options are a joke . Coffee isn't terrible tho and the bread samples where good.,1
This location always gets my order wrong. I usually get the Power Veggie Burrito fresco. Today I got the burrito- no fresco and refried beans. Plus they forgot the cinnamon twists. And there was no one there. I definitely won't be back. I rarely have a problem with Taco Bell too. Don't come here if you want your order correct.,1
"This place opened where the old Teakwoods used to be.  

A few minor decor updates, that actually made the atmosphere less inviting (although I'm not sure how this is even possible?)!  

Untrained staff, a horrifically stinky bathroom, and a soda line that tastes like dirt - all factors in making this place one of the worst places I've been to in Phoenix.

There did not appear to be an owner/manager on-site - strange for a new business.  I don't think I'd eat here if you paid me.

TIP: (and this one was from our waitress who used to work at the old Teakwoods) If you want a mixed drink, try something with juice since it comes in a bottle and not out of the soda gun that has always had something wrong with it and tastes like dirt.",1
"To big. The layout makes it take too long to get around. The meat department is unreliable. I purchased 3lbs of low-fat ground beef that looked very fresh. When I got it home and started to use it, it was all brown inside. You can clearly see they tried to dupe me into thinking the entire 3lbs was fresh. Instead they hid the old meat inside. Bait and switch. I don't think I will ever be able to purchase meat there again.",2
Always happy with Clever Koi. The menu is unique and the service is always good. I like how the owners all work there because you can tell they really care about their customers and the experience that they have.,5
Zeroes ... straight zeroes... incorrect phone number in correct website and stole my secure deposit f****** thieves,1
"The restaurant is open to the casino floor, which I thought was a bit strange. It's not as loud as one would think though...

Being from Chicago, there are many good steakhouses there...This would rate at about average for me..Ordered the filet, decent cut, flavor was ok...Service was a bit slow at first, but managed to keep up...",3
Had the Haymaker Benedict!! Amazing :) hubby had pulled pork skillet - wasn't quite hot enough and they made it right immediately! Great food great service!! We will be back :),5
"So excited to find this little gem!  Right by my work and I am so excited!  Friendly, fast service, clean establishment, and the food is great too.  I will be back!  Thank you Yelp for helping me find this place!",5
"Gives Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong (Los Angeles) a run for their money.

Pros:
   Excellent meats
   Great side dishes
   Superb salad
   Good service (They cook for you)
   Reasonable prices

   Plenty of parking
   Smoke managed well
   Nicely spaced tables (Ample elbow room)
Cons:
   None",4
"Dolce 21 Dessert House is a new dessert place located inside Pacific Mall. I tried the Ferrero Rocher candy shake in large size which is essentially a milkshake made with Ferrero Rochers, milk, and ice cream blended together. Then it is topped off with some rainbow coloured candy bits which is why they named it a candy shake. It is $4.95 for a small and $5.95 for a large. The shake has a very rich taste of the Ferrero Rocher chocolates and any chocolate lover would love this! However I would prefer not to have the candy bits inside because it takes away the smoothness of the milkshake. They also sell soft serve ice cream in interesting combinations such as soft serve with cotton candy. Overall I enjoyed it and would likely come back to try their other milkshakes!",4
Had a very nice memorial service for our Dear Aunt. They did a wonderful job of setting up the logistics and were kind  and caring. My sincere thanks to Jamie and Pat who exceeded my expectations. Everything from their suppliers - flowers to catering went exactly as planned.,5
Nice place to take pictures and walk. They have a bunch of trails you can do. Didn't have enough time to do one but i will. 7$ to go in. Only 20 min car ride from the last vegas strip.,3
Excellent sushi restaurant. Their fish is always fresh and the service is always friendly and fast. Only downside is that they're one of the very few sushi restaurants in the area that don't do do delivery.,5
"$3 drafts after 3.

$3 drafts

After 3.

Honestly, I didn't know that was a thing when my boyfriend and me decided to randomly visit on a Friday afternoon. The place was dead when we walked in, which always makes me hesitant. Not this day. Which I had started with a lunch at Meat & Potatoes.

The bartender was extremely friendly and, what do you know, he's a friend of Blake's, our favorite bartender at M&P (small world). Since we had just eaten, we didn't order anything off the menu so my review doesn't include that. I can't wait to go back and try some of their items, though.

The design/layout was not at all about what I was expecting. It's nice and I love the blue and black colors. I didn't interact with the hostess or waiters/waitresses at all, but they all seemed friendly. Their draft selection was also much better than what I was expecting. What can I say? I don't think the North Shore's selection of bars and restaurants is anything to write home about, but BZ's could definitely change that, especially if the food is spot on.

I enjoyed myself for the couple of hours we were there. Because we were the only patrons for at least an hour, hour and half we got to pick the music! Stone Temple Pilots station on Pandora. It's the little things, people.",4
"This is my favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant. I believe it is a privately owned restaurant, not a chain.  The pasta is fresh and the sauces are made to order. I always rate an Italian restaurant based upon how well they prepare their lasagna and this place does not disappoint. On my first visit I was surprised to find veal on the menu. I hesitantly ordered it believing it would be over cooked as most places do. Boy was I surprised! It came out perfectly! Moist & tender. Very tastey!  I've been back numerous times since then; each time ordering something different.  I have never been disappointed and neither will you.",5
"This taco bell is great, every time I come here people are so polite and happy. They do an awesome job",5
"A great place for lunch between classes.  Service is prompt and the food is delicious.  Everyone around our table loved what they ordered and alot of food envy happened.  Friend swears by the charred salmon sandwich, which looked great and everyone seemed to like.  I had the seafood pasta which was amazing, perfectly creamy and delicious.  Great portions and reasonable price.  Would definitely go back again and recommend to friends.",4
"After having trouble with some of this stores' customer service representatives over the weekend, today I was able to work with a store manager (Jacob K.), who went above and beyond to help me with my phone problems. His customer service was outstanding in a way that easily made up for the unpleasant experience I originally had with this location.",5
"Why the **** does DQ exist? It's expensive as **** and taste like ****, I prefer McDonald's ice cream",1
"Amazing chocolate Italian ice, best since I lived back east. Next time I will try the pizza or a sandwich, they look very good.",5
"Owner and wife are awesome, always treated very well here. Hard to find friendly workers on east 4th and here is where to find them.",5
"Good Folks
Good Food
Great Place to Eat and Meet Friends

Breakfast is Great.
Try their Steak & Eggs. Steak is very tender and flavorful.",5
Very very poor service. Waited an hour for our food and when it arrived everything was cold. The waiter was the only one here and was stressed. He reacted very bad to the order being cold did not apologize for the error. I do not recommend going here at all.,2
Great crew at grave yard shift! The rest are ok they get a 4 star.,5
"I have been saving a certificate I got two or three years ago for my birthday that was for a FREE DOZEN of glazed donuts. Finally after my birthday this year I decided to use it since I didn't get a cake and I drove all the way across town to go to this nearest location just for these donuts that I have only had maybe 3-5 times in my life. The certificate was almost special at this point because we always wondered when we would finally use it, my fiance and I. Today was the day though, and we went in the early morning when they should be at their best.

We finally get there, and the manager lady up front barely acknowledges us, and as soon as we start talking they INTERRUPT US to talk to someone ALL THE WAY IN THE BACK of the store about their preparations. Then we tell them we have a certificate and they instantly say, ""LET ME SEE IT."" All short and upset and rude sounding. It's like, fuck you lady we earned this years ago, you probably eat this shit every day. This is a ""special treat"" for us. Plus we both struggle to keep from being underweight so we of all people could USE some donuts.

So they tell the cook person to make the dozen and we wait for a few minutes, and then we receive the box all fresh and hot and exciting. We go in the car, and open the box. It smells like vanilla. I have never eaten a glazed donut that smells like vanilla. My fiance picks one up, and it sags downward like wet paper. We both take bites of it and it is like a glob of sickly vanilla dough in our mouths. So WHY are people saying you should ONLY get the FRESH GLAZED donuts?!!! This is insane. It tasted NOTHING like Krispy Kreme, NOTHING like glazed, and NOTHING like a donut. I seriously think either people have the WORST taste in food because I would not even feed this shit to my dog, or these rude workers who were COMPLAINING ABOUT WORKING in front of us to each other as if we were not even present deliberately shorthanded us decent quality food.

This experience contrasts the day that we got the certificate where a worker let us choose any donuts we wanted instead of all 12 glazed, and gave us an extra ticket which is what we used today. And those donuts were awesome. WHAT HAPPENED in a few years?! That location closed down, the other location closed down, and the third one near us. And we go to Bell to get awesome donuts and it is THE WORST. I even gave these donuts a second chance. They cooled after an hour and solidified A LITTLE BIT. And they still tasted like dung. What a waste of gas, of a specially saved certificate, and a waste of birthday excitement.

I think these people need a day off or two like they were saying..",1
Great atmosphere and service. We did not have a reservation but they accommodated us anyways. They did forget one of our orders but by then we were too full to notice.,4
Here for brunch.  Ordered Sqawk Peak Bennie with Bloody Mary and a juice.  However I received a coffee instead.  Mary was a bit watered down. Then the waitress brings my husband and I both the wrong meals.  He ate his because he didn't want to wait.  I sent mine back for the correct order.  Not a great way to start the day. The kids received cute puzzle menus without crayons. The interior is nice and warm.,2
"We came and Will was insanely accommodating amd went sbove and beyond to take care of us. Pizza was good, Sangria was better.",5
"Handel's Ice Cream is one of the best things about Northeast Ohio.  And I don't mean that as a Northeast Ohio joke... I really do mean it.
My husband and I used to live dangerously close to the Stow location and would come here regularly, even waiting in line in below-freezing temperatures for this legendary stuff.  Yes, it is that good.  Best chocolate milkshakes I've ever had.  They have more flavors than any other ice cream joint I've ever been to, including many unique-yet-amazing flavors like peppermint stick, deep dish apple pie, cherry cordial, just to name a few.  There's nothing similar to Handel's where we currently live, so we try to get some every time we're back in Ohio.",5
"I've enjoyed lunch at Yupha's at least 1-2+ times per month for the past 4 years. The service is fast and the food is consistently delicious. The all-you-can-eat salad bar (with its delicious peanut dressing) at lunch time is a nice touch, as well as their quieter/darker ambience at dinner. All their entrees I've tried are excellent, although I'm partial to their curry dishes. I see this remaining a favorite for years to come.",5
The food is just as fabulous as when we first started eating here a couple of years ago. Vegans beware though: the mock meat and mock seafood contain whey and are not vegan.,5
"Wow! What a wonderful car buying experience, thanks to Adora, our stellar saleswoman. Adora doesn't judge you by what you wear or what you drive up in. She is kind, helpful and doesn't rush you as she gets you the best deal. After the purchase, she was an exceptionally patient teacher as she set up our seats, radio settings as well as syncing our phones to our new car. Her patience and her willingness to help us use and enjoy the luxury features of our new car as well as her genuine excitement in helping us buy our dream car made this a great experience. Call her!",5
Best vegan restaurant in Las Vegas! Come here every week! Orange chicken is the best on the menu.,5
"My daughter celebrated her 8th birthday party here.. We got our own private room, pizza, drinks,, and we were able to bring our own cake.. Our host was Keilani and she made sure everything was organized perfectly. Your two hour party pack includes jump time for all the children with a private dodgeball game and then cake and gift time in the private room. They even clean everything up for you no big mess for you to clean up! They have a rock climbing wall as well which is pretty neat when they reach the top they can ring a bell, this was my daughters mission but she was unable to make it, maybe someday soon! The kids absolutely enjoyed being here and we plan to come back for jump time in the future. Thank you Rockin Jump and Keilani for an awesome experience!",5
"This place is really impressive. The decor, the service, the food. I would go there for a special occasion or a business dinner. I had the soft shell crab entree and it was scrumptious. I paired it with a lovely Mer Soleil Chardonnay. It was a memorable meal. I can't wait to go back.",5
"This place is amazing. One of my favorite Thai places! The pla is so good and no other place has it like this. My favorite is the crispy coco curry fish, the sauce is so delicious I want to swim in it.",5
"Great place for downtown. Interior was open and interesting. The menu left something to be desired. Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious but the menu was limited. I ordered the scallops with sweet potato wrapped in bacon. It was so tasty but there was no side dish. For the price of this dish there should have been a ton of the snap peas on this plate. For desert I ordered the salted caramel which was so good but it was runny inside. Next time we will come in just for wine and the meat/cheese platters that they offer. You can choose your cheeses and different meats to accompany your wine and nosh.",4
"oh man! I'm addicted to this place like crack cocaine! PLEASE NOTE I'VE NEVER TRIED DRUGS TO INCLUDE CRACK COCAINE BUT I CAN IMAGINE HOW AN ADDICTION WORKS BECUASE I'VE GOT ONE FOR THIS PLACE. Apple fritter warmed up, ham & chees croissant complimented with jalapeno's & a Thai Tea! Of course the other doughnuts are delish but you gotta pimp your Fav's-am I right people.....",5
"I eat at this restaurant all the time. I have tried many other local Indian food restaurants, but this one is by far my favorite. I get the Malai Kofta every time. It is always amazing. My boyfriend has tried many of the items on the menu and has loved all of them. The service is also fantastic. We are greeted like old friends every time we go into the restaurant. The server always remembers us and asks us how we're doing. I've also ordered from them through Grub Hub and their food travels really well. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Indian food!",5
"My husband and I were caring for his sick mother and we would always pass Oggi Restaurant on our late rides home. We sat at the bar, and was met by our friendly server Lauren, who took her time explaining specials and suggestions.  We were blown away by her entrees, desserts too. 
Carmella cooks with her heart and soul and she will always come out and talk with her customers after a hard night at work. The homemade pasta, especially her lasagna is my favorite.  Summer brings the abundance of fresh vegetables from her garden which makes the experience even better. Her zucchini blossoms are heavenly.  We try to dine there weekly or more. You won't be disappointed. 
It's like going to mom's for dinner. A hidden gem!!",5
Delicious Cappucino & perfect Peanut Butter Cookie,4

"I have been worrying about my hair loss for a while. I took Biotin and I used Rogaine at least 3 times a week. My result was same with no improvements!!
     Then, I met Dr. Christopher Asandra at an event. I decided to go into his office for some more information about ""hair"". Dr. Asandra was extremely friendly and his staffs were very professional. Especially, a beautiful young lady at the front desk (Tanya). Today, will be my 4th session with Doctors of Hair. I am very Happy to tell you that I highly recommend anyone who's experiencing hair loss to go here. You will be very Happy like me.",5
"How anyone can give this place any less than 5 stars, blows my mind!!! This place has the most amazing pasta I have ever tasted!  They cook it fresh right in front of you. I am riding with my husband on business simply to eat here. I really don't want to do this review as I don't want to wait when I go there. However, everyone should go here! I live in South Carolina and don't live close...thank God!  I would weigh a thousand pounds from eating here every night!",5
"Last week, I walked by the front entrance around lunch time, and there were several customers eating their burritos right on the sidewalk, as if they couldn't wait to eat them! As I had just had my lunch, I came back today to give it a try.  I ordered a small steak burrito.  I had everything except beans and rice, because I wanted to taste the meat and other toppings without feeling bloated afterwards.  It was still very filling without them.

I was really pleased by the quality and freshness of the steak and veggies.  Steak was tender and full of flavour.  I rarely come across cilantro as fresh as this was.  You can get extra guacamole free of charge (not like some other places).

The biggest test -I enjoyed every bite from beginning to end.  The staff were also very friendly and service was fast.  I noticed that several customers who had placed their orders online had their food ready when they arrived.",4
I've been here twice and I like how clean it is. Prices are reasonable and there was no wait both times I got my nails done here. I recommend it over some other places I've tried in North Charlotte.,4
"A friend and I went to Bannock knowing we would order the duck poutine pizza. The waiter was really descriptive about the pizza, and advised us that it would be more than enough for two. For your average pizza-lovers, he was right. But my friend and I really love pizza and poutine, and were able to devour every last bit of it. 
It was delicious and hearty to no end. The hearsay is that usually a party of ~4 will get a pizza to share, and then order individual dishes. We definitely would have done that if we had more people!

For the price ($16 before tax and tip), the poutine pizza is well worth your money. To be honest, I can't say it was mind blowing, but it's definitely deserving of a chance!",4
"Decent food, i am here some days for lunch break. Usually the line moves pretty fast.",4
"My boyfriend and I are huge coffee drinkers and I often find myself at Lux down the street, decided to come in and try this little place after hearing some great reviews!
The hostess Rhyann was SO friendly and kept us company while we got seated immediately. The concept of the place is cozy but not too cramped, and I love the idea of the open kitchen with the bar. 

Our server was very helpful and led us to fall in love with the duck and roasted beets. I kept it simple with a chicken ramen, which with their house Sriracha was a nice little kick!

Try their banana foster bites too- delicious. 
Overall, come here for fast service and a unique but flavorful noodle and appetizer place. Great for date night.",5
"I haven't been to this location in 5 years...now I remember why.  There is one person behind the counter and 7 people in line.  Is this a joke?

Never again.",2
"I didn't see this store previous times that I have shopped on 16th so it was nice to peruse their items the other day.

The place is beautiful decorated, with lots of earth tons, beautifully displayed store racks and a sexy glass counter area for exclusive designer jewellery.  I did come away with a very nice light avocado-ish shirt for $50; this was on sale from $300.  It was flowey and had revealing areas on the side which I plan to camouflage with duck tape.

The place has great style and designs but it really is very expensive.   Expect to pay 200 and over for items in the store, and jewellery is around that price range as well.  If money is not an issue for you and you love flowey sexy cotton like pieces then this is the store for you.",3
"Wow! I certainly enjoyed my vegan experience at Seed Shack. The Acai Seed Bowl is amazing!  My family and I enjoyed not only the food, but service so much that we dined here twice this weekend. Thank you Seed Shack!",5
"Sandwich déjeuner exquis!  Soyez patient pour une place, mais ça en vaut la peine!  Leur café à lui seul vaut le détour.",5
"A friend invited me for lunch and he decided on Jun's. I'm not a Korean food fan, but it's growing on me. With limited knowledge and experience, I was skeptical but I was alos pleasantly surprised. The café set-up made it great for a lunch stop. The menu was simple. The dish I had was a mixture bowl of meat, rice, veggies, fried egg, etc. Needless to say, it was tasty and the condiments were plentiful. Had no idea this place has been here...pretty close to home.",4
"This is a dive bar, it's not a college bar, but they can make some serious drinks. I love this place for karaoke and am embarrassed to confess to getting hammered accidentally (one drink at Cappy's is like 2.5 drinks at most other bars) and then trying to sing on multiple occasions.

I never was too impressed with the food, but I never came here for the food. In fact, if you want good food within walking distance, go to some place like Harris Grill. But if you want good drinks and a good time in an environment that you can be laid back in, this is it.",4
"My favorite place to shop is Publix. This is the second Publix that I have been to. Usually, up at the one in Huntersville. Look forward to another Publix opening up in Cornelius. In general, I shop at Publix like 3-4 times a week. They are so convenient for me that after hours I run and pick up milk and snacks.

Their Publix brand of products are really good. The roasted chicken that comes in BBQ, Lemon Pepper, and Mojo. Always, someone to help out with recipes for fish and cooking meats.

Prices are inexpensive and there is no need for a membership card. Always shop for their specials and weekly sales this is where you get the best bargains.",5
"Just cruised thru drive-thru at 11:15 am. (They open at 11am). Had grilled chicken burrito-delicious and large portion for $5.99. Grilled chicken with pico de gallo, salsa and guacamole rolled perfectly. Also tried grilled chicken street taco on corn tortilla with cilantro and fresh onion. I added their hot sauce-excellent too! And only $2.49!!! Great food-great prices-very nice people!",5
"I was thrilled to visit a Piggly Wiggly!  I snapped up a Piggly sweat shirt. There are other touristy items--t shirts and license plate holders, for example. 

They have normal grocery store items, with a great selection. Produce looked fresh. Store items were well stocked and organized. Everything had prices. 

Staff were helpful and walked me to an item I was looking for.",4
"I was thoroughly disappointed with this company and their services. I went in because I was experiencing pain in my left foot. They recommended orthotics and a steroid injection in my foot to help with the discomfort. I was apprehensive about the injection they assured me the only side affect was minor redness and irritation the next day. They also told me my insurance would cover it. I mentioned that I work with doctors and maybe I should wait, but they strongly recommended it. I purchased my orthotics out of pocket and the injection ended up not even being covered by my insurance because they ran the code through as a surgical procedure. After $600 for my orthotics, $60 copayment for 3+ visits, another $150 for the injection my foot is still in pain and has divots in it from the strong steroid they used. My foot looks deformed and has major atrophy (fat loss). I even referred one of my clients to them when I initially went and she also forked over $500 plus and she was treated very poorly from the beginning. I mentioned all of this to them and said that I would like them to take a look at what they did to my foot but I am not paying anymore out of pocket. They refused to even see me, stating that this was their policy. I couldn't and still cannot believe the lack of concern this company has for it's patients. They're not appreciative of referrals and paying clients. They are not willing to work with or even see their clients to remedy a situation that was made worse by people that are supposed to be helping. I feel I was treated like a number, and the money is all that counts not the issue at hand. All in all, my foot is very much still in pain and now looks horrible! I would give this company zero stars, this all coming from a medical care professional. Do more research before deciding to go with them.",1
Got my iPhone 4 screen repaired for a great price. Location is kinda hidden but found it.,4
"I really like Canal Street.  As tourists, we went here many times.  As residents, we've only been here once in the last 11 years.  It was time to go back and see if it was as good as always and it was.

The bread basket consisted of a couple of pieces of tasty lavash and two rolls, one a walnut and raisin and the other I don't know because I didn't want to fill up on bread.  The butter comes with a piece of processed cheese spread with grapes and cranberries.  Very tasty!

I started with a house salad that comes with all entrées.  It's built almost like a small Cobb salad with greens in the middle and small mounds of diced tomato, bleu cheese, candied walnuts, hearts of palm, cucumber, and hard boiled egg around the perimeter.  I got bleu cheese dressing and the salad was very good.

My main course was the 8 ounce filet done black and blue.  With the steak came some summer vegetables cooked very little.  They were crispy and they were good!  I ordered a salted baked potato as a side.  My steak was done perfectly and the baked potato with that rich salt was very, very good.

For dessert, I got the Canal Street bread pudding with blueberries and a Bourbon whiskey vanilla sauce.  The bread pudding was different.   Not only was there the vanilla sauce, but the bread had a distinct chocolate infusion and there was chocolate sauce along with the vanilla.  Excellent.

Service was very good.  Iced tea was refilled without asking, finished dishes were removed promptly, and there was adequate time between courses to relax and enjoy the surroundings.  I wasn't rushed nor was service slow.

I like the room.  It has a New Orleans theme with one side being a mural.  In about an hour's time, the lights on the mural slowly dim and the fluorescent paint starts to glow with the blue lights and it looks like the lights in the mansion along the river or on the paddle wheel boat were turned on.  Then the lights slowly pick up and eventually it's daytime again.  I've always liked that ambiance and it was there again last night.",4
"Food was so tasty, and portions were bigger then expected. Comfortable place, they play good vibe flowing music. You get a street view which i enjoy looking out. I was smiling going in and smiling coming out. Waiter was friendly and polite and was very knowledgeable of the menus and seemed like he had pride in want he was serving. You could tell he liked his job and the environment was very comfortable i could of sat and ate and sipped coffee all day. :) Recommended you visit. Good job chefs! Bobo mango smoothie was yum. MiKaew soup Fabulous w/ hot tea.",5
"Had the pancakes, Carrot cake and  Bacon Cheddar and both tasted great!",4
"My girlfriend and I thought we would give this place a try. We went on a Friday night. Busy of course we were put on a short wait, no biggie. 
Once we got our table we asked for a gluten free menu if available. We were told nothing in the restaurant was gluten free. 
As a chef.. I immediately knew our waitress had been ill informed. Our waitress was also lacking being personable with us. Very much felt we were getting in the way. 
So I began to navigate the menu. Successfully picking out various gluten free items. 
My girlfriend and I ordered 6 sushi rolls totaling out to 28$ .. so if you are GF the options are there you will just have to find them. Good luck..",3
"Dave (last name Davis I think?) did some work for me - it looks awesome. Lettering work, helped me transfer it from my friends writing to the tattoo. Did exactly what I wanted. Got the placement 100% perfect. Accommodating. Done fast and accurate. 9 letters total = $200... they were small..... But, I'd go back because it was no bullshit and it looks awesome and it's permanent -- so worth what I paid. It was done right and looks amazing. He obviously knows what he is doing and that is what I wanted. It was my 5th tattoo, and I've had extensive work done. He had an old school feel, as did his work - so I'd go back to him again for another something classic.

Thanks Dave, carpe diem!",5
Great authentic food with excellent service. Terrific value. We loved the amount of choices on the buffet. Clean !,5
"Panera is the worst. I've never been a fan to begin with but as of late, they've  descended into total ineptitude. Do not expect to get out of this place in less than 20 minutes. I stopped in to get a dozen of bagels for the office. They attempted to pack them in a shopping bag just tossing the everything bagels on top of the cinnamon crunch ones. They could not even follow the most basic request to leave the bagels unsliced. Not to mention the bagels looked pathetic and barely cooked. Panera in general has gone down hill, this one at a faster pace than others.",1
"The story of my life.. 

Of the 12 yrs i have lived here.. I have used Sun Town laundry for 10 yrs for all my dry cleaning and laundry purpose..  

They have done a decent job mostly, except the very few times they have messed up a print on my dress or got some color smudged, may be like 4-5 such minor incidents in these years. This is a family  run place and the minute you confront them they get defensive instead of apologizing for their carelessness. Not only to me, this has happened to several folks among our group of friends. I had it 2 months ago when they lost 4 pieces of our clothes. I didnt pay the waiter in the shop hoping the owner would call me, but NO.

Meanwhile during a festival of last yr, My friend found a cleaners on Yelp, by i17 and bell rd.. She and i used them for doing our Indian traditional clothes and such and they never spoiled any of the glitter on our clothes, they did the job very well.

The place my friend found on yelp is really cheap compared to Sun Town Laundry, very clean, very organized. Their billing is computerized and they have fixed rates for everything. My husband and I have been using their service now and extremely satisfied.",1
"I'm sorry, did I just take a bite before a picture? Omg yes. This place is amazing. Thin and crunchy crust; perfect sauce to herbs ratio; tasty and warm cheese; pepperoni slices to top it all off...one word: PERFECTION. I don't think I've had a bite of such tasty goodness in so long. My friends, above all, this slice cost me $3.75. Yes, I want to cry tears of joy. 

Trust me. When you see the man tossing the pizza dough from the outside window, you will know that this pizzeria is in it for the long haul. There is little indoor seating though, so hopefully you are coming to taste this pizza on a good day. There are some picnic tables on the outside of the place for you to sit.

I heard that there's also a spicy oil that you can add to enhance the flavour. So keep posted for the updated review!",5
"I finally decided to stop by Kneaders for the first time the other day, it only took me like 2 months! I went through the drive-thru and the first thing I noticed was that their drive-thru is ridiculously slow. They are really going to need to step their game up on that because that is the fastest way to lose business, nobody wants to wait 20+ minutes in a drive-thru line! Anyways, I ordered the sausage and egg croissant, turkey artichoke panini, orange rolls, and the caramel macchiato. The sausage and egg croissant and turkey artichoke panini were amazing! The orange rolls needed some work though, they tasted a little doughy. The caramel macchiato was unbelievable, I still can't get over how much better theirs is v. Starbucks!",4
"This place was great, everything from the staff to the food. Our server provided a great experience. Its not all you can eat but 2 of us split the pork and beef dinner for 2 and it was plenty of food.",5
"i have been dining with all the valley serranos since 1986.  consistently good food, excellent service, fantastic chips,  bean dip is presented to every table, hot sauce to die for.  fluffy rice, flavorful meats, sauces and cheeses.  excellent.  it is a family place...so not right for a sexy sophisticated evening, but it is always clean, consistent, and just plain good.",5
"Great little place for breakfast/brunch! We came here around 11 a.m. on a Tuesday and the wait was only 15 minutes. 

Petite Americano: Typical breakfast platter with bacon, eggs, and potatoes. The difference is that it comes with your choice of a pasty, juice, and coffee. I think this was the best deal. 

Cobb Salad: All the ingredients looked fresh and the portion was super generous. 

Steak and Eggs: This was my biggest disappointment. This was a special and was priced at $28. However, the steak matched the quality of an Outback Steakhouse. It was dry and bland. I had to douse it with Tabasco sauce and pepper for flavor. Comes with a huge side of fries. 

Burger: Meaty and hearty burger with melted cheese, sesame buns, and animal sauce. 

The hostess was warm and inviting and our server was a little forgetful with our beverages but her demeanor was super sweet. The ambiance is so peaceful and the interior is classy yet simple. The food is slightly overpriced for their breakfast menu. I would rather come here for dinner than brunch.",4
"We were so excited that Tia Rosa was opening in Chandler after eating so many times at the Tia Rosa in Mesa while we lived there for 9 years. While the decor is minimally like the Mesa one, the food is far from it. I was so disappointed with my Chicken Mole, it looked like gelatin on the top (skin of the mole sauce). My husband had the red beef burro that had no red sauce and we barley made it home in time for him to get to the restroom. The food took 5 minutes to get to our table after ordering. I have always graciously waited for the fresh cooking of Tia Rosa in Mesa, of course it will take some time it is freshly cooked and made. 5 minutes? I should have known right there. Go to the one in Mesa if you are wanting the real Tia Rosa. So sad too this was my birthday dinner. Oh husband asked me to add that the beer was warmer than the food.",1
"The food here was ok. I had the naked chicken burrito which would have been great but it was overpowered by lime juice completely. The service was friendly and food came out quickly. It did the trick in curbing our hunger, but I won't go out of my way to come back.",3
So glad this was across the street from the Red Rock hotel!  Several acai bowl choices as well as smoothies and cold pressed juices.  The large acai bowl is huge but wonderfully delicious.  Located in a strip mall next to Costco.  I wish we had a place like this in Iowa!,5
"I needed a last minute notary for a car title I was selling and I called the branch and spoke to a teller apx 10 minutes before they closed. The teller on the phone was kind and told me to have her hurry and I assured her she'd be there no more than a couple minutes past at the most. She said that was fine. I called them back to let them know she was on her way. 

My wife walked up at 7 and no one made eye contact with her until 7:01 and they turned her away. They refused to help her, even though the process would've been quick. The notary was apparently with another customer, even though the teller told us that my wife should come in. They were closed.

Another customer walked up while they were turning away my wife and they helped that customer. 

My wife called them on the way home, at 13 minutes after 7pm.. and they were still answering the phones and doing business. But yet, they had my wife rush in to make it before 7 and refused to see her 30 seconds after 7pm. And when my wife complained about it at 7:13pm to the teller still working on the phone, she got hung up on. 

Take your business to another branch that has the decency to not treat their valued customers so poorly. Customer service at this location was a joke. But had she gotten there 30 seconds prior maybe they would've been kind and professional?",1
We make special trips to Prescott for Lone Spur so we are super excited to have one in the valley! We still drive from the East Valley but it's worth it! Our favorite breakfasts. Huge amounts of food! The French toast and the biscuits and gravy are my favorite. We've loved everything we've gotten here. We will be back over and over and over again!,5
"Sushi...Mmmmm and ALL YOU CAN EAT!!

If you love sushi...you have to go to Makino's!!!!!!",4
We have tried to eat at this place 4 times now. There hostesses are rude and not customer friendly at all. We have come down for events at the T-Mobile arena and can never get into this place. An event gets over that started at 6pm and the entire crowd is hungry. This place closer there doors. It's impossible to ever get a seat.,1
"7/15/12

Wow, this location is SMALL!  My first taste of Four Peaks was at the cavernous Tempe location, which I found to be too large, too loud, and too busy for my taste (plus there's not enough parking spaces!).  This one in Scottsdale is more to my liking.  Intimate and not too dark inside (outside, however, I couldn't tell if there was patio seating since it was so dark), open sight lines from most points in the restaurant, the women's restroom looked and smelled clean, AND parking isn't a problem.

Came in to order a pint of peach ale, knowing that I can't buy it at stores.*  I inquired about the possibility of taking some home and was told that I may purchase a growler.**  A pint costs around $4, but during happy hours costs $3.25 (pitchers $14/$12).  Reverse happy hour starts at 10p.  Please note that their register's clock runs slow, so you may have to wait a few minutes longer before you can start getting happy.***

FYI, if you've misplaced your driver license, you may use a passport to get past the I.D. checker at the door.

*Whole Foods sells growlers now, and most keep peach ale on stock.

**Growlers are pressurized receptacles that hold 64 oz. of whatever beverage you want to take with you.  A new growler costs $14 and can be refilled for $10.  It is recommended that people finish the 64 oz. within 24 hours of opening, but I was told that the beverage will stay fresh for longer than that.  BTW, peach ale is offered for takeout AND isn't a seasonal variety like I thought it was.  FYI, I didn't enjoy the ale here as much, since it wasn't ice-cold, like the one I had at Tempe's Lucky Break.  I'll have to remember to ask for a frosted glass, if it's available.

"My husband and I decided to try out Ruth's Chris for my birthday. One year away from 30, might as well go all out!

We had a reservation for 9pm, but since we had a babysitter for the night, a rarity for us, we decided to go early and sit at the bar. We arrived around 7:30 and were shown to the bar. All three bartenders introduced themselves and were very friendly and attentive. My husband ordered a glass of wine, and I had a peachy pear tini. They are not shy with the liquor. This was the most stout martini, especially flavored martini, that I've ever tasted. But although it was heavy on the liquor, it still tasted great, and was a good pre-meal start. We were so hungry and impatient that we decided to order our appetizer at the bar instead of waiting. We split an order of the stuffed mushrooms. They were cooked perfectly, amazing texture, and the stuffing was amazing. Shortly after we finished up our appetizer my husband informed the bartender that we were ready for the check for this portion of our meal, and they sat us at our table a half hour earlier than our reservation was set, which was great.

Our server was very friendly, very attentive, and very pleasant. The restaurant itself is lovely and feels fancy, especially for folks like us to whom ""eating a good steak"" generally means a trip to Outback. The wine menu was pretty extensive, and my husband had two more glasses of a red wine, while I decided on a Patrón margarita. Once again, the most stout margarita I've ever been served at a restaurant. It was delicious.

We started with salads; my husband had the Caesar, and I had the strawberry almond salad. The portions were large and both salads were delicious. My salad had just enough dressing to taste it lightly but none was visible on the plate. 

For our main meal, my husband had the 22oz Cowboy ribeye rare, while I ordered the filet medium. Both of our steaks were cooked exactly to our preference. We both agreed to being served our steaks on the 500 degree hot plates, which was an excellent decision as they kept the steaks at a consistently good temperature for the duration of our meal, including for me, and I'm a fairly slow eater. We ordered steamed broccoli and potatoes au gratin as our sides. The potatoes were delicious. The broccoli was undercooked, but honestly were an afterthought and neither of us cared about it with all of the other delicious things we had at our fingers.

For dessert, we decided to treat ourselves and split two desserts. We ordered the chocolate sin cake, and at the suggestion of many other Yelp reviewers, I had to try the créme brûlée. The chocolate sin cake was very rich and delightfully textured. A few small bites was enough to sate my desire for anymore; it tasted delicious but was so very heavy and rich I couldn't eat much. The créme brûlée however, was easily one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had placed in front of me, and my husband agreed. The sugar was perfectly caramelized on top, which made a thin crispy layer on top of the decadently textured créme. It was like eating cream cheese air. My husband and I have already talked about taking a night to go sit at the bar and specifically order nothing but the créme brûlée. 

Overall we had an excellent experience here. The service was fantastic and all of the food, minus the broccoli (but really who cares about that) was truly fantastic. With the steep prices it's not something we will be doing often, but it was a great night of splurging and very much worth a night of spoiling ourselves.",5
I am gluten-free and all of their gluten-free items were absolutely delicious. They have tons of flavors and everything was so moist and well done.,5
"Absolutely fantastic. I got the seafood soon tofu combo with bulgogi. Everything was so delicious. The side dishes were great too! Makes for a very filling and satisfying meal, and the flavor was authentic. Definitely will frequently visit for lunch, the prices are great for the amount of food you get. Great service, great interior and atmosphere, great food. Can't ask for anything more.",5
"Ok, revelation this was the location for my 50th family birthday dinner. Yes admittedly I was probably one of the oldest in the room.

Synopsis: service excellent, food outstanding, cocktails amazing.

We dined a scaramouche last week and most of us hated (and I don't use that word often) the cocktails. Here we found each one unique, beautifully presented and most important tasty.

The oysters were all delicious and fresh even though I don't understand serving a hot sauce with something so flavourful.

Duck confit- score. I think there was deep fried apple in there.  Steak - beautiful cut and perfectly cooked but I have to admit I dont like my steak covered in sauce but I think that was my mistake. The fennel salad had too much of a similar creamy texture. Fried oysters were lost. Daughter had trout and which was excellent and beautifully paired with watermelon radish.

Perfect white ganache to sip on.

Would highly recommend this restaurant.",4
"One of the best if not the best Korean bbq I've eaten at! The sides are really good, especially the sweet kimchi cucumber! I had the bulgogi bibimbap and it was phenomenal! You can check in for an ice cream macaron, which is also really good. I will definitely come back here.",5
"This is definitely the place to come and get your nails or hair done. The girls are friendly, they talk to you and they always get my nails done the way I want them. Both Dottie and Linda do nails, and Marissa does hair (for both men & women)! They are the perfect all in one salon. I love it here!",5
"Never again.

Me: hi do you have Trenta size?
Cashier: yes we do what can I getcha?
Me: can I get a Trenta green tea iced latte?
Cashier: nope only comes in venti size.

Went to coffee bean instead.",1
"GREAT food! Had the Al Pastor Tacos and it was some of the best Al Pastor I've ever had. My wife had a chimichanga which was equally great. The kitchen messed up and we didn't get our appetizer until it was brought out with our meal, however a manager immediately came over and apologized and comped the appetizer. Service was great on the whole.",5
"Went to LA Fitness for about anyone as it was convenient and close to my house. The equipment was outdated and there were always several that were broken/out of order. Rude and pushy staff who approach you during your workout to pressure you to sign up for personal training. Locker room always has a foul odor. 

Eventually cancelled my membership, but they didn't make it very easy.",2
Beautiful place. I've never seen a place like this in Vegas. Great environment and design. Coffee and pastries were good as well! The whole package here.,5
Very fairly priced vegetarian and vegan options for with a great ambiance. I tried the vegan mac n cheese and couldn't tell the difference from the real thing!,5
"When I walked in and it was relatively empty, I wasn't expecting much. However, the sushi was very tasty and I would totally stop again if I'm in the area.",5
"Sip is appropriately hip. I wish this trendy place originated when I was in college at ASU, I might have actually studied when I went to a coffee shop. Sip provides a lax environment for business meetings, study sessions, or just day to day meeting up for coffee or craft beer. 

The patio is dog friendly; therefore my pup is another fan of Sip. 

The craft beer selection is large; you won't find a beer you can't enjoy. The coffee is amazing if you order it tall or strong, don't mattahhh. Oddly, I enjoy paying at Sip as much as I enjoy lounging because their tip feature has appropriate saying's in order to justify the tip... if you really are only tipping 15% in today's era, the service was just, ""allllllllright"" If you aren't tipping or tipping the bare minimum, you don't appreciate Sip and what the unique spot has to offer! Because a 30% tip is worth it for the soft pretzel alone. 
 
From the paintings, soap dishes, to every intrinsic detail is what makes Sip so posh and unique. We most definitely frequent the new neighborhood addition with paws and arms wide open!",5
"The Whisky Attic is a must visit when coming to Vegas.  It opened my eyes to a new way of enjoying alcohol.  Rory was a wonderful host and made us feel at home.  JD dropped whisky knowledge like he invented it.  He knew so much and made the learning experience interactive and fun.  One of my boys and I had the 10 whisky tasting, while the others had the 5.  Well worth the visit!  I have already recommend this place to many others.",5
The ony thing i could think of was the same level of disappointment that i had when i visited the new wet n wild location last year... What is with these companies closing their locations down and making locals wait years for a new establishment that has less to offer than their previous location? Terrible way to earn your old customers back. Seems like a trend happening in Vegas and its really doing bad for tourism when all the companies are just penny-pinching and reopening shitty locations. Dont reopen if you can't deliver!,2
"Amazing food! The drinks were nice and strong. 

It's too loud-turn down the music!!!",5
"I am such a procrastinator. Two years ago today, Just after the stroke of midnight on April 1, 2014 I asked Diana what she thought about getting married while we were visiting Las Vegas. She said let's do it. We went to sleep,and woke up, and started doing a quick research on how to get married in Vegas.  We went to Walmart and bought some rings. Then we went to the courthouse to get our Licenes. Next we were going to  go to a wedding Chapel that we found online during our search. As we walked of the of the courthouse 2 people confronted us and asked if we had a place in mind. One guy who was representing Vegas Simple Wedding Chapel gave us a coupon and wallked us over to the Chapel. We had both been married before so we felt we didn't need a big fancy expensive Wedding. We had a simple wedding. It was realitively inexpensive.  Nothing Fancy. Just a quick simple ceremony.  I would have gave them 5 stars but for whatever reason we did not recieve  the pictures that the brochure promised. By the time we were back in San Diego and realized the short coming it was too late. I would recommend them if you're in Vegas looking for @ wedding Chapel with reasonable prices. Please tell them George and Diana Noble from San Diego Reccomended you. Oh getting back to my opening statement. I told them I was going to review them on yelp. Well here it is two years latter. I always keep my promises, sometimes it takes a while.",4
"Similar to Zoe, I wish I could give them a higher review. They truly do have a unique selection of glasses. However, I would stop there. Simply browse, but take your business elsewhere. Why? The service is some of the rudest I have experienced in Toronto; and it wasn't on a single occasion either. I have gone in and they have suggested some frames for me - great. But similar to other reviews, they pushed me right into the payment process as soon as I identified a pair of frames I liked. When I told them I'd like to think about it, they seemed miffed that I wouldn't hand over my credit card, right then and there. ""Fine"", I said. They wrote down my name and the model number of the frames in their special ""book"", in case I came back. And come back I did; this time with friends, to get their opinion. They had sold out of my frame. No matter, they wrote down the model number in their book! Hallelujah! I asked for the model number, so I could simply google the frames, and show my friends a photo of them. NOPE! They have a policy of not giving out model numbers. Uhhh...excuse me? I understand it's to combat shoppers from using this info, and ordering them from some place cheaper (Which suggests that they're charging a top premium), but when I'm a returning customer who has purchased from them before, and they can't give me a model number to show my friends? Frankly, that's rude. The owner spoke to me harshly and rudely, with little respect, in front of my friends. Not to mention the owner (and manager) had his tone change completely when he found out I had purchased from them before. In my opinion, if you can't treat a person with dignity and respect from the moment I walk in, you've already lost my business.

So, if you're in the market for some new glasses, take a look at this shop (with your blurry eyes), but keep on walking. This place does not deserve your hard earned money. Or even your insurance company's money. And if you think this review is scathing? If you can't treat me with respect, I have no reason to treat this business with the same.",1
"The worst night sleep I've ever had. I was in Pittsburgh for an important interview and I thought staying at a Marriott would be a safe bet. 

The room was spacious and well decorated. But there were long hairs in both the sink and shower and had clearly not been cleaned-gross. The curtains were not long enough for the windows and the light shone in all nights because of street lamps right outside. The shower knob also wasn't screwed on and fell on my foot-surprised it's not broken. The air conditioner was SO loud and rattled on and off all night-causing me to wake up too many times to count. It also wouldn't stay on for more than a few minutes at a time and there were just so many noises. 

When we told the front desk our issues, they just said ""I'm sorry about that"" and nothing to try and rectify our terrible night. We are silver elite Marriott members and stay at Marriotts all the time-but YIKES!!!",1
"Great place to sit & people watch. We always take a break here before we continue on our way. This time we tried a margarita, it's $13! It was good & cold in this hot day.",5
"Came here straight from the airport.  So convenient,  about a mile away from the car rental facility.

The place is very clean. The servers were very friendly and greeted us as soon as we walked into the restaurant.

Food was delicious.  Everything was freshly made.  Had the palabok and chicharron bulaklak. The palabok had  a lot of shrimp and other mixed ingredients in the sauce. It also had a good amount of crunchy cracklings and hard boiled egg slices.   Wish it had calamansi instead of lime.  The chicharron bulaklak was very light and crisp. Not oily at all.

I wanted to order the halo halo but didn't have enough room... may make a trip here just for the halo halo.",4
"Come here and get pizza  it's by the slice or whole. Great place for a lunch date, or while you're waiting for a massage at the massage school next door",5
Always out of chicken. Staff in a hurry and throws your food around. They act like you are bothering them.,1
"Still run down a little bit, but its a wonderful place for the kids and very well staffed with good people. I work here on the weekends and notice the trend of it being a getaway for some folks. Outside has been completely reconstructed, added a new/additional soccer field, tennis courts, spaced the parking better and the new playground is very nice. Its good to see city taxes are finally doing some good in the community.",2
Amazing service wine and happy hour everyday a must stop for music friends and eats......excellent daily specials,5
"Liberty Burgers & Wings is a cute little burger place on Main Street Markham. 

The dark wooden decoration inside the restaurant is chic and comfy with quite a few booth seating. However, on this nice fall like summer afternoon, I decide to enjoy their smallish patio...which as around 6 tables or so overlooking Main Street.

The menu has a great choice of how you like to dress up your burger to make it ""gourmet"". However, as usual I opt for the basic Hamburger ($8.99) but upgraded it with Sweet Potato for an extra $1.

100% Organic Beef maybe good for my body, but for me taste is the most important. The patty was grilled and has a great charcoaled flavour... seasoned well. It is a little dry but acceptable and went well with their signature sauce.

The Sweet Potato Fries was so so so good, one of the best I ever have. But I don't know if they forgot the dipping sauce? Though I don't really need any as it tasted good the way it was!!

Liberty Burgers is A-OK for their burgers, I might have to come back to try their wings over a pint of beer........",3
"Perfect location! No casino, and no smoke= awesome! Perfect for the family! Very spacious studio room but I love the one bedroom penthouse with floor to ceiling wall glass! I wish the depth of the swimming pool with be deeper. 4 feet is too short and made swimming a little bit difficult. The gym is ok.",4
Took a Kate Spade watch here for repair and they did an excellent job. No wait and great customer service. Highly recommend!,5
"I came here with a few friends today for a late lunch after a race. The service was quick and very friendly.  We ordered Totchos (tater tot nachos) to start and they were delicious! The buffalo chicken dip disappeared within minutes as it was better than any buffallo chicken dip any of us have had at a restaurant.  The seasonal cocktail menu was also great- I had the rum spiced cider and a pumpkin pie cocktail.  To top it off, one of the people in our group has a severe nut/bean allergy, and the entire staff was very accommodating in making sure no nuts or beans touched our food. Will come back again for sure.",4
"I visited Milestones with a friend a couple of weeks ago. The experience was not memorable, hence the delayed review.

We opted for no appetizers.

I ordered the apple beet salad that comes with chicken fingers. It was a good sized salad with lots of mixed greens however the apple slices were so thin and sparse the flavour was lost. The same issue with the small cubes of beets. The chicken fingers were also small, and there was only three of them.

For almost $20 there wasn't much value and I would not recommend. OK service.",2
I've been in line for 40 minutes. Only 3 cars ahead of me in my lane and 3 in the other drive thru lane.  Unacceptable,1
"Huge selection of books at very competitive prices. I often find books at this location which I'm unable to at other used book stores like ABC and BMV. Plus the books at this store are almost always cheaper. 

I would like to point out though that there isn't a graphic novel or comic cook section, if that's what you're interested in.",4
"Everything that could be wrong was! This was our First time there tonight. Half the bowling lanes were broken. So, we waited 2 hours to bowl, after dealing with one very rude and sarcastic employee. He complained it wasn't really his job to check people into bowling. The kiosks for the game cards were all broken, 70% of the arcade games were broken. The redemption room for tickets looked ramshackle, mostly empty, roped off with a sign saying save your tickets for another time closed. I then ordered nachos while finally bowling and had the ends of the green onions (with roots growing out of them) mixed into my nachos. Bowling is limited to 1 hour and shuts done after that hour even if your in the middle of a game. Bathrooms smelled and had no toilet  paper, soap or paper towels. So I told the staff about the bathrooms so they were aware. An hour later, I went back to the bathroom. The paper towels were stacked on top of the holders and still no soap. Overall looks run down, and way too many things wrong. My friends and I will never go back.",1
"Tempest is a one of a kind seafood spot in Madison. The ambience is fun. It's classy, but not pretentious. It's warm and comfortable but kind of tacky in a wonderful way. The food will not disappoint. The scallop appetizer is among the best scallops I've ever had. My husband LOVES their swordfish (which isn't always on the menu, but is a frequent addition to the list of specials.) Everything I've eaten there from steak, to salmon, to tuna has been amazing. I also really enjoy the oyster shots.. they have a number of different alcoholic shots that they put an oyster in and serve it for $6. I like the one that has a tomato base, and the dill one is also quite delicious. I highly recommend Tempest for a nice date night out or for any special occasion.",5
"This was a stop over for our trip home.   The shuttle was convenient.   
The room was updated and clean.  

The only issue we encountered  is that there are no restaurant choices with in walking distance to this hotel, with the exception of a restaurant in the hotel across the street.  That was my error as I did not investigate that.   We had to return the rental car that evening because of an early flight.  Plan ahead if you don't have transportation. 

Would stay there again.",3
"I contacted Lifeguard Solutions to find a lifeguard to hire for a party I was having at my house. They were more affordable than another company I called and were willing to provide the lifeguard even if alcohol was served - something I found others couldn't do. Our lifeguard, Sammy, showed up on time and even helped us set up a few last minute things for the party! She was such a pleasure. She got in the water with the kids and swam with them instead of just sitting on the side watching. If you are planning on having a party and think a lifeguard may be necessary, we would definitely recommend them and Sammy! The ONLY small feedback I have is that I called the company and was only able to get a response back via text. That's fine, I text most of the time anyways but can see how it wouldn't work for some.",5
"Wasnt ready in 30-45mins. We called and they didnt know how to drive in the rain, something they arent use too. But they should of called to tell us at least. Pizza is good but not hot. Not worth the price they charged us for.",3
"In a recent search for a new fur baby a friend recommended WWW. I'm glad she did because I ended up with 2 new fur babies. We have a crazy dog who frightens our older cat so I needed a kitten introduced to dogs and able to hold their own. The animals there were all well cared for and integrated between dogs/cats. Our new babies instantly put our crazy dog in his place and now have no fear of him, they even approach him! My 3 year old at times can be a little rough but the kitties still cuddle up with him. They are everything I could of wished for and now a permanent part of our growing zoo.",5
"Hands down one of the best parts of Pittsburgh. This is the first stop when I show anyone around the city. Brie tarts have never disappointed. 

Ambiance: very quaint little store front that gets crowded very quickly. If the line is out the door, they like/expect to keep the door closed and have the line continue to form outside so always dress accordingly. No indoor seating, but has a few outdoor seats if you're lucky enough to grab one during the summer. Fortunately, Lawrenceville is a great place to walk around especially on Butler Street. It's also across the street from a park with plenty of benches and swing sets. Not a place where they love to recommend things, they like to keep the line moving so decide what you want before you get up to order. One of everything is never a bad call. 

Food: The Brie Tart is hands down one of my favorite items in all of pittsburgh. Extremely unique with a fluffy Pasteur wrapped around slices of Brie and onion. Pain au Chocolat, Croissant aux Amandes, and all other pastries are delicious, I try something new every time depending on what I am in the mood for. Bacon Baguette is one of my favorite breads, it is exactly what it sounds like, you really cant go wrong. 

Convenience: Hours can be odd but always easy to swing by on the weekends.",5
"THIS PLACE ROCKS!!! My bf is definitely the nerd of the relationship but old games is something I can nerd out to. In terms of selection, the store is HUGE! They have so many game systems I didn't even know existed and their pricing is fair. Other stores seem to jack up prices on everything but not this place. They sell newer games cheaper than Gamestop (gs sucks). The customer service is beyond awesome. I would definitely suggest coming in when Remy and Scott are there. They know everything and couldn't be more helpful at explaining their tech speech. My only real complaint is that usually when I go, the place seems to be packed so it can be hard to concentrate but at least it means they're making money and won't be going anywhere soon. I have some friends coming down to visit from Michigan and I can't wait to show them this place. There's definitely not any place like this in Michigan",5
"Stopped by for a late lunch and found an overpriced, unpleasant atmosphere staffed by mostly disinterested loud servers.  Perhaps it is better during brunch hours but for lunch it was pretty bad.  There are quite a few options in the same strip so pick another spot.",1
"I just moved in the area and I was in the mood for some good sushi. The menu had so much to pick from but I ended up getting the ""911"" it was soooooo good. I have never had sushi that tasted that fresh before. I also saw that they had all you can eat specials, which is cool. I will most def be a regular :-)",5
love this place! i have went here with so many friends/family and have tried many dishes on the menu and it was never a disappoitment! they got wide range of selections too! from korean to hawaiian. service is always a delight too.,5
"Got the incredible Groupon of dinner buffet at $5 each person. Figured we couldn't go wrong, even if it wasn't great. Well, have no fear. It's one of the most extensive Indian buffets (and at dinner!) that I may ever had. Some 20 oz beers to go along, made it a great time. And the owner was incredibly courteous and accommodating for the four of us, too. My only wish - as a non-meat eater, I would have loved a fish dish along with the vegetarian (and some fully vegan) dishes.Now it will be my go to place when going to Tempe and worth the 25 minute drive even without an excuse.",4
"Yep, went early on a Friday, just as other reviews have said, wrong signage out front, end of a strip mall in the target center, I think they were all speaking korean, wierd, maybe the chefs weren't, but no matter, AYCE was had by the three of us, not one thing bad to say. 

I sportfish for tuna every year, and will eat my catch for breakfast lunch and dinner until it's gone. Everything served here was fresh, and it was poetry on a plate. Blows oishi sushi away.",5
"Had reservations for New Year's Eve party of 5 regular table not hibachi at 4:30 the waiter came took my order for appetizers and walked away without taking my guests app orders so we Flagged down another waiter  to go ask ours to comeback so everyone else could order too, ridiculous! Then we placed our dinner order -all sushi  and one order for hibachi, the hibachi order finally came but the raw sushi we ordered didn't come until we asked multiple times to see the manager by the time they came with it one person in the party had already left due to the time it took, keep in mind it wasn't busy at all and they refused any discount do to their obvious understaffing so we ask for it to go seeing as we had New Years tickets to an event. The food was mediocre at best, there are way better sushi and hibachi restaurants with much better consumer service than this dive! Party of 5 never going back to this place.",2
I have been going to Q's Tailor for years since I was a teenager. She is always very friendly and fairly priced. Great turn around time. Highly recommend to anyone.,5
"I love this place!!! Even though it is a little pricier compared to where I moved from but the products they use are amazing! And their service is great! I always make my appointment with LeAnn and she is the best!!!! There is only one thing that I can say though but I think this is at every nail shop, is that they speak their language and it's a little uncomfortable at times because makes you feel like they are talking about you. But other than that.... This place is AMAZING!!!",5
Disappointing. Not authentic. We tried the Dragon Druken Noodles and Yellow Curry Chicken. The Dragon Druken Noodles was extremely sweet and the potatoes in Yellow Curry Chicken were huge and uncooked in the middle.,1
"music was good after a late concert serves food till 1 am which is great when you have missed dinner and drinks where delicious staff was friendly,helpful. price range $$",4

big fridge in our room. pet friendly. lots of cheap supermarkets and shops around. loved it.",4
"Just had steak, bacon & sweet potato tots (& hot sauce!!) for breakfast, Scott had the Hawaiian Breakfast - loved it!!! Soooo good!!",4
"Wow. Major disappointment.

We used the free house wine offer, and gave it to my mom.

I ordered the ""crispy"" (deep fried) and ""sticky"" (covered in mozz cheese) balls (I guess they are trying to make the old ladies blush when they read the menu) in diablo hot. ($10) for two. I also ordered a Caesar salad. 

My guy asked the owner (who was our waiter, and parks his lambo on the sidewalk, in front of the place) what dish is their best, especially for first comers. His answer... Chicken Parm.... really? Chicken parm? He got the marsala.

We ordered calamari for an appetizer. It was not crispy. It was flavorless. Seriously, needed salt and pepper.

My beef balls came (haha, they are suppose to be ""gourmet). The extra money you spend to have them ""crispy"" and ""sticky"" go to waste. There was no texture to these meat balls. They were pure mush. The sauce was pretty good though, and spicy.

When the marsala was delivered, I knew that the veggies on the side were either frozen, or out of a can. The carrots were the circles with the crinkle pattern on them, and the broccoli was just the stems, not the fluffy tops. The marsala sauce was overly sweet.

Overall, Meh. No thanks.",2
Great service. Happy Hour specials are a deal that you shouldn't pass up. Every day of the week is a new special. Multiple tv's with different the sport games going on. Must try the Zipparita!,5
"Not just a foot massage!  Their regular price is $30 for 1 hour, but they have a grand opening special which is a discounted price ($6 dollars off).  Your massage will be in a communal room with at least 3 other people, with dim lighting and your typical relaxing spa music.  I don't think you really get a choice in your massage therapist unless you specifically request a gender (When we went there were 2 women and 2 men available to give massages).  Massage here will be more like a full body massage with more emphasis on foot reflexology.  The massage therapist I had used more deep tissue pressure which was fine with me, with some range of motion techniques to stretch the muscles.  (For those that are not deep tissue type of people, they ask to make sure the pressure is OK for you).  The massage was the right amount of pressure for me, and for less than $30 an hour, I will definitely be coming back here for more massages, even when the regular price is in effect.

P.S.  Be sure to wear loose clothing here which will help with the full body part of the massage.  Also, bringing cash for tips ($5 recommended minimum) will help so you can give your tip right to your massage therapist when you are done.",5
"Expected amazing , not amazing. 
First I was the only one in line instead of greeting me he takes a phone call, not a quick one.

I tried the lobster tacos at 13.18 for the very small portions I was expecting high quality tasting food, it was only average taste and too high price point for serving size.  


The food wasn't horrible , but I wouldn't repeat.",2
"I'm officially a Choolaah head. I almost always get the Samosa Chat...it might be one of my all time favorite foods. I also really enjoy their Pav Bhaji, which is like an Indian sloppy Joe. Pile it high with onions and squeeze some lemon on top, and I feel like I'm back in India!",4
"First trip to this location, they're way too busy trying to upsell you with egg rolls, drinks and donations to charities to get your order correct. I wasn't dinning in and got the teriyaki chicken but asked for the sauce on the side, which upon arriving home I discovered it wasn't in the bag, when I'm paying bucks for lunch I should at the very least get my order correct, but then again is it my fault for not checking my bag before leaving. Good thing I'm Asian and know how to make my own teriyaki sauce....",5
"This place serves fantastic sushi. I've tried nearly ten different kinds at this point, and have always been delighted. It's rarely crowded, has lovely outdoor seating, and some of the best and friendliest waiters I've ever encountered. I wouldn't take more than about four or five people here as it isn't that big, but it's very well decorated and the many windows make it feel comfortably spacious. The sushi selection is quite wide, so it's easy to find something you're certain to like, and the appetizers are cheap and delicious. If they were in a more expensive location I'm sure they could charge much more, so enjoy the relatively cheap prices! If you become a regular you'll be recognized and extra-welcome, which is good since if you like sushi you'll end up going back often.",5
I usually don't come here unless I want a quick breakfast before work. I just wanted to say everybody who works here in the morning are some of friendliest people I've ever met. I have a feeling some people only complain about McDonald's (the company as a whole; not this particular location) and don't give their employees recognition if they go above and beyond expectations. They definitely deserve it.,5
"I'll keep it short.  Ordered a door gasket for my freezer that was not a stock item.  Picked it up after I was called and that weekend I simply took it out of the box to measure and line up against the old one that was still installed, looked like a good fit.  Started taking the old one off and the door started to break into pieces.  Time for a new freezer.  I put the gasket back in the original box for return.  A 11 days later I call and ask if I could return for a refund and was told yes.  Stopped by later that day and the counter salesman opens up the box to inspect.  He tells me it has been installed and cannot issue a refund.  I explain to him it was never installed.  I doubt it was ever inspected when they received it from a different warehouse, it appeared to have some wear when I first took it out of the box.  Now I'm down $150 and a liar.",1
"I had my friends birthday party at Dot Dot Dot on Friday. I purchased a membership a few weeks before my visit. When you arrive, they scan your ID and provide you with your membership card. You walk down a long brick corridor which gives you more of a secret speakeasy feel. They serve the best drinks I've had in charlotte so far. For a good drink I used to only go to the punch room at the ritz Carlton but Dot Dot Dot is definitely strong competition. The drinks taste amazing but be careful, they are very strong. You will want to pace yourself for sure. 

The food taste good but don't come hungry. The portions are small so if you're expecting to fill up, you'll need to order many items before feeling satisfied. Their small plates are full of flavor so if you just need a snack it's a nice treat.

The only area I hope improves soon is the noise level. It was next level loud. I'm not sure if it was the other guest or the music but if you're looking for quiet and intimate, make sure you go during a time/day the place is empty. Otherwise the noise level is at a 10.

I will definitely go back.",4
"Came here on Friday to celebrate a friend's birthday.  I didn't stay long.  I had an OK time and at the moment, other places really suaded me otherwise.

The place is dark and filled with Asian decor and influence.  It's located in the middle of a Chinatown strip mall with one of my favorite Pho restaurants, Pho Kim Long.  I was baffled as to why there was bouncer, since we were the only reason the place was busy.  There's a bunch of couch seating in the back creating an intimate setting for a small party.  Unfortunately there was no food and I was super hungry :(

The bar was filled with TVs and LOTS of seating.  There was also a DJ there doing Karate Karaoke which helped liven up the crowd.

I had an OK evening.  Unfortunately that might not be enough for me to consider this place in the future.  Chinatown is filled with little jems and I don't really consider this place on that list.  If you're looking for a venue to hold a party and not looking to get an upfront charge to save the space, maybe this place is perfect!",3
"I went to this location on my first trip to Los Vegas, I already knew I wanted to get a pearl from an oyster the day prior, because I have seen videos of it on YouTube. 

$15 is a great price for the experience of opening the oyster, however they really try to sell you on buying a piece of jewelry to go with it, so keep that in mind if you're not good at handling sales people. 

I did end up buying a silver necklace for my 6.5mm silver pearl, but I really like it and it wasn't like atrociously priced. The necklace locket was $45 and the chain was $20, but at that point they wave the $15 fee of the oyster. Although I was kind of up-sold into the necklace, these pieces are very well made with a neat adjustable chain; I don't regret buying them especially since it appears to have little to no nickel(Maybe just on the clamp of the necklace which barely caused any reaction) just as the sales lady said. I usually have a problem with metal jewelry, even if I am assured that it is safe for my nickel allergy. I had no other metal chain because of this problem, I just avoided them, but now I have a necklace chain I can wear for hours without it causing me to rash.

Their little ritual for the pearl is really fun, they also have like a color horoscope which is fun too. Like silver means ""Love"". Don't worry about not getting a pearl, these types of oysters always have a pearl in them because of the way they are farmed, I had some people I told about my pearl question about that.

So if you're looking for a fun time and want a pearl, I would recommend this kiosk. Just try to be aware of their sales tactics if you don't want to spend a lot.",4
I've only come for lunch and I was very intrigued so much so I wanted to have dinner here. Tonight it so happened my boyfriend and I came to have dinner and we were blown away with such stellar customer service. We met Nick who is one of the owners as he walked around and made everyone feel so welcomed. He introduced himself and asked if we needed anything. After that we felt we had made a new friend. While sitting at their Wok Bar the second owner who appeared to be the top chef was so informative with the dishes. Jarred was phenomenal and extremely thorough. He even made us a dish and said it was on the house. Over all our experience here was the best I have ever had in an establishment like this. I will definitely come back.!!!!,5
"I just left lunch at Kings Fish House and it was AMAZING. Everything was perfect. 

We ordered lots! Started with the crab cakes and they were so delicious and full of fish. I got the clam chowder to start before my meal and I am from the East Coast and know my chowder well and this one is right up there. 

For my meal I got the scallops and shrimp blackened with garlic mashed potatoes and the grilled zucchini which was SO good! They change the menu twice a day so you know the fish is beyond fresh and when they run out, that's it. There is no freezer to run to and defrost more which is a great addition. 

Our service was spectacular. Our server Karyne was friendly, attentive and made sure we liked everything we were given including the iced tea. 

All and all from beginning to end this was wonderful and I cannot wait to bring my friends here!",5
"We chose Dan over 4 other landscapers and found him to be honest, dependable and someone who stands by what he promises.  He delivered our beautiful backyard in 3 days and was on-site and working along with his team.  He not only incorporated our vision but added special touches that just enhanced our backyard.  We haven't seen this level of competence, work ethic and overall professionalism in many years and Dan brings all of that to his projects.  We couldn't be happier with his fair price and workmanship.

"Surprisingly good. Fried Zucchini had a nice batter that stayed crispy to the last zucchini chip. We shared the the Pulled Pork and Pork Ribs which were both succulent and flavorful. The hand cut fries were also crispy and not too soggy, which is a common case for hand cut fries. We'll be back when we're in the mood for some good ol' American food.",4
"This place is solid. If we had these in L.A. I'd go often. Love the style and layout. Love the small name soda fountain with organic ingredients and Mexican coke. We got a couple of salads the other day that were very good, but what makes this place a 5 for me was the Sante Fe wrap I had for lunch. It was so good...spice was perfect.",5
"May I say as a Southern girl, I am picky about pound cake. Daphne's delighted the day with her perfect crusty topped vanilla pound cake. The cake was a hit! Reasonably priced and delicious. What more can you ask for?",5
"Perfect little quick all-you-can eat sushi place in Summerlin. If you're craving sushi and have an appetite, this is your place. Octopus poke is great and I would definitely recommend it. Service is usually pretty good as well, even when they get really busy.",4
"Phoenix is lacking in good Indian restaurants, and that is compounded if you're in the mood for South Indian food. Cafe Krishna is a perfect example. I would come here again on occasion only because I often crave South Indian and there are no superior alternatives. 

I ordered the sambar-vada. The vada was not as hearty or flavorful as I would ordinarily expect. It was also served somewhat lukewarm. The chutneys were mediocre. The vada was a bit too soft for my liking. Dosa is harder to screw up, so I enjoyed that a bit more, but still nothing out of this world. 

The service was poor, unprofessional and a bit chaotic. The environment and atmosphere were good. I was not impressed by the cleanliness of the bathrooms, which for me is always a bad sign for what must be the cleanliness level of the kitchen.",2
"I went to a Spring Training game here on Monday 3/17/14.  The stadium is just off the freeway so I arrived in the area about 75 minutes before the game.  The traffic was backed up on the freeway and the main street was a mess.  I waited almost an hour to get to what I thought was the parking lot only to find out it was the parking for the local Marriott.  People were very frustrated cutting others off in traffic, being aggressive and I witnessed a road rage incident while sitting in the line.  By the time I made it to the Marriott lot, they had been out of spaces for 15 minutes but they did not have a method to notify people.  I blame the Marriot for most of the mess but the City of Tempe need to plan better for events.
Inside the stadium I found the place to be less than average for Spring Training games.  The food was not good, the customer service was average and we could not hear the speakers very well.  I will stick to other Spring Training facilities to see some games in the future.",1
"If you walk out with a bag, you know somebody is in a good mood. I think I only find myself in establishments like this while in Vegas. The service was as you'd expect it to be in a place like this.",5
"The more I get to know some people, the more I like dogs.  Yep, that tends to be true more often than not.  

So I dig places that cater to my dog.  The staff here has always been helpful (when I've come in with or without the dog), and has been patient with whatever questions I have, even if it's just directing me to something in particular.  

I've never not been able to find something at this store, it's clean, and the staff is pleasant. Definitely a great place to go for your pet-care needs.",4
Wonderful service. I came to this post office today with ten heavy boxes and the postal workers didn't blink an eye!  They kindly gave me a cart to bring the boxes in and were so nice.  As I was waiting for them to process my boxes I listened to the other workers and they were accommodating and cheerful.  How refreshing!,5
"Oh man this place was delicious i want to go back again. I went yesterday night with my bf and it's  $20 for dinner which was cheap because I've spent more at casino buffets. The food was amazing, it was seafood night which is what i wanted! The fish was pretty good for az seafood. The smoked salmon was the best the also had clams shrim and fried seafood. Other than the seafood, the other food that was there was fresh and amazing! Best dessert at a buffet I've ever had! The area was clean and the staff was nice too. Im not a big casino arizona fan but this place was worth it.",5
"It's my first time coming to AGO and it's for Yayoi Kusama's infinitity mirror exhibit! I am impressed with how nice the AGO is and how pretty the infinity mirror rooms are but I do have some feedback to hopefully help others that will be going to this exhibit after me, as you want to get the most out of your experience and I clearly did not. And you know how hard it was to get the tickets and you gotta line up like 6 times when you are there...

(1) You camera should be in normal mode, and not selfie mode. Because you are taking a picture of your reflection from the mirror in front of you. Some people in line were confused so I just want to put that out there so you get the most time in that room. Obviously you can take your picture any way you like.

(2) You will feel rushed. You get 20 sec for most rooms and 30 sec for the more popular ones like the souls of millions of light years away. And why do you get 30 sec for those ones? Because they force you to go in 3 people at a time...so be prepared to be in there with a stranger who probably only lined up a quarter of the time you lined up for because there's a single's line (see #3). 

(3) Single's line: if you came to this exhibit by yourself or you don't care if you go in with your friend or not, you can line up here and the line goes a lot faster, probably under 10 min, while the normal line is 20-30 min. However, this is where a lot of people in the normal line was complaining about. Everyone obviously lined up the long way just to get a picture with their loved ones or their friend...I know it's art and you are suppose to experience it, but let's be real, 90% of us want that perfect picture with the millions of lights!! But now you all of a sudden have a stranger in your photo. I know it's that way because you can take more people in a certain time slot, but I honestly am willing to pay more for more time in each room and to go in only with my friend. AGO, why not pair up the singles so they can go in with other singles instead of forcing them into other's people's groups?

(4) Wear comfortable shoes as you will be lining up 20-30 min for each room...meaning you will be there standing/ walking for at least 2 hours.

(5) Souls of Millions of Light Year's Away: the room darkens and dims for half the time you are there. So depending on your luck, you might only get like 10 send to snap a picture! There's also a line going down the middle of my face, which I didn't notice until afterwards. Beware of that line in the middle!!

Overall I really loved the artwork I saw and I loved that it was interactive and fun, but AGO should really improve the way they run this exhibition to enhance people's experience.",4
Loved it here! Food was excellent! Staff was awesome! Thanks! Can't wait to move here and eat here on the regular.,5
Terrible pizza.  I can buy a better pizza at HT.  Staff is very unfriendly. I don't see why this has so many stars.  Nasty is the word to describe the unsavory taste. I would rather drive 15 miles to Wolfmans Pizza.,1
"Hi, T-Mobile S Rainbow! Let me give you a quick customer service 101.

HERE IS HOW YOU PROPERLY GREET AND ASSIST A CUSTOMER: ""Hello, my name is __________. How may I assist you today?""

I dropped by T-Mobile during my lunch break as a ten-year AT&T customer hoping to make the big switch. They had this huge promo going on ""switch from a carrier and get a free iPhone 7 (when you trade in your current iPhone)"". Upon every transaction, sales associates should 1) assume customers are there for the promo or 2) at least talk about the promo.

Imelda assisted me without proper above-said greeting, so she missed the whole point of why I was there and our time including a lot of backtracking and waste. I tell her I want to make the big switch, so she proceeds to activate a new line, makes me pay for a $25 SIM card, then looks at me - ""So you already have a phone for this SIM card?"" ""No, I wanted to do the free iPhone promo."" ""Oh. I saw you had two phones so I just assumed you already had a phone for me. If I knew you wanted to do the promo, I wouldn't have charged you $25 because under the promo, activating a line is free."" Huh?? Maybe if you fully questioned my needs without jumping the gun...

She then had to void the $25 transaction which for some reason she was reluctant to do. Her whole manner was rushed and lacked genuine concern when explaining things to me. When going over details of the promo, she rambled in her jargon that only phone courier sales associates who have to talk about it 100x a day would understand. She sees I do not get it, emits an exasperated sigh, then condescendingly writes on a sticky note what my options are. I have questions, and she responds to them in a nope-you-can't-do-that tone.

Ugh, the whole ordeal was so stupid. I made up in my mind that I wanted to switch from AT&T to T-Mobile and she changed that buying power in an instant. I stopped the transaction saying I'd think about my options and return after work. She said she's working there until 8pm. Hell no was I returning to her. I took my business to their Silverado location where THEIR T-Mobile associates absolutely redeemed their company's name and went above and beyond for me. Off to leave a five-star review on their site.",2
"I'm doing a reviewing marathon today, and it wouldn't be complete without me giving my props to my second home, Boba Tea House. I plan a lot of meals that require me to visit Lee Lee just so that I have an excuse to get a boba tea here. I'm embarrassed to admit this but my friend even got me one of their T-shirts (that I always forget to wear) so that I can get 10% off. 

I've had boba tea at several other places in Phoenix (the Street, Lee's sandwiches, the Pho place in this same complex) and they are either too sweet, too watery or the boba is undercooked. Boba tea house is always good and they have a ton of different flavors and aside from boba they also have different kinds of jellies. 

Great ones to try

- Coconut snow
- Thai tea slush
- Taro milk tea
- Honey green milk tea
- Lychee milk tea
- Jasmine milk tea

The only thing I can't recommend is the food. It is not good. Everything is fried and it all tastes the same: bland.",4
"Great customer service!  Lauriann helped me out with an upgrade to my phone. She was very thorough and help to me with an installation of an accessory in my car. They were very busy when I walked in, but was still able to accommodate me with my time restraints.",5
Amazing. Had the sandwich and couldn't be happier. Annoying that they don't have ketchup for the tator tots though,5
5 stars for Great tasting food and affordability.  If you like Vietnamese this is the best I have found in the west valley.  Not fancy decor however food makes up for simple atmosphere.,5
Saw an episode of this place on the cooking channel and of course had to try it out. A-FRICKEN-MAZING.  The food was was like nothing I've ever tasted.  I will try to go again the next time im in town.,5
"There was this cashier that's shit rude, and ended up getting my drink wrong anyways. Lol why is she always there when I go.",2
"Bought two $16 slushie drinks, no alcohol in them
Go to Fat Tuesday's instead",1
I ate beef rendang and it was the most delicious rendang I have ever tasted in United States. Totally recommend it,5
"Ok. Since I've become completely and totally addicted to tsoynamis, it's only fair that I update my review. At least once a week I find myself craving a tsoynami. Even my boyfriend, who is adamantly against vegan and soy products, has fallen in love with the tsoynamis and often accompanies me on my trips to get them. These desserts are also HUGE. For $4.50, you can easily split it between two people. I usually like to eat my own so I can bask in my gluttonous glory. All of the baked goods are also excellent. I have not been disappointed by anything I've had here. I've been converted to a Nami believer!",5
It's a very impressive restaurant. Full of surprises! We really had a great time after party. Food are very good and the environment is awesome! The restaurant is very special! I loved it.,5
Probably the best place in Aurora to grab lunch or dinner. Quality and service is consistent. Place is really small and has great character. The outdoor patio is awesome. Drinks are very good and they have a solid beer selection. Their burger is best in town. Definitely worth a try.,4
Went for happy hour. Great apps and a great beer selection. The wait staff is very friendly and helpful.,4
"I dig this place! The staff is friendly, the food solid, the atmosphere fun and casual. A nightclub for adults who have thrown away their shiny shirts and Versace suits. A fun time with good eats. Give it a try.",5
"I had combination 18 which was fair at best.  My wife had the taco salad and she rates it slightly higher.  I'm not impressed enough to come back.  Service was slow, but with only two other tables I'm not sure why.",2
"I went with three friends and we were all very pleased with our food. Excellent chips, the chicken fajitas were outstanding, chicken enchiladas were very good. All of us would come again!

Service was great!",5
One of the best meals we had during our weekend trip in Charlotte. The honey chicken pasta was absolutely delicious. The stroganoff was also very good!,5
"One of my favorites and I'm a major foodie. Pork Belly Tacos and Lamb Lollipops are insane. If you don't get there early, it's a pretty long wait. We don't ever concern ourselves with the wait, we chill at the bar with the amazing creations that the highly knowledgeable bartenders have to offer. It's not a place to go to just eat--it's an experience from the moment you walk in to the last bite.",5
"Best veggie burger in town with avocado and sprouts it is delcious!!  Go early getting a table is tough once happy hour hits but also had a great bar area.  Other little secret is that their chocolate cream pie is the best in town.  Seriously,  definitely order it or make a trips just for it.  Also,  good wines, of course.
As far as kids go I think it depends on the time of day.  It has milkshakes and good burgers for kids but in the evenings has more of a bar vibe.",5
"Great neighbourhood spot to go to for breakfast on the weekend. Staff are attentive and friendly. It was steadily busy and we never felt rushed to leave. I had the grilled cheese on sourdough with extra pulled pork. It came with a simply dressed kale salad. Ordered a small order of fries on the side. Delicious!

Will definitely make the effort to return. Most people in Leslieville head for Lady Marmalade and subject themselves to a ridiculous wait. Come here instead. You can order different types of waffles or have your big breakfast of eggs, brioche, etc. A much more civilized experience for a weekend if you ask me.",4
"Am I missing something here??  I've been anxiously waiting to visit this place because I've heard so many positive things about it.  Heck, it's been featured on the food network!  So I finally went today. 
Got there around 6:30 pm on a Friday evening and the tables were filling up quickly.  Cute decor, island music and nice youthful ambience.  I was feeling good...but not for long.  
Chips and pico were served. Took a quick glance at the menu and knew what I wanted.  Fish tacos!  What else?  The place bears the name so it must be their specialty, right?  Wrong!!  I ordered the blackened mahi fish tacos.  ($10.50 for 2 tacos +1 side).  They were wrong in all senses of the word.  Where do I even begin... 
Ok, so the plate looked nice but the fish was dry and warm (I like my food hot unless its supposed to be cold).  It had absolutely no flavor.  Blackened is supposed to be very flavorful people!  The fish chunks tasted like stale, warm, low-sodium canned tuna with a hint of, I don't know, garlic powder maybe??  It had a smear of avocado, a few shreds of white cabbage, a few shreds of cheese and a drizzle of ""white cilantro sauce"" which was so scant that I couldn't even taste it.  It was decoration, I guess.
For my 1 side I chose the refried beans.  Yuk!  Tastes like cheap canned beans.  I ordered a dos XX special lager on tap and it was flat and watered down.  Even the beer was a hot mess.  And here I am in shock!  I'm not quite sure what all the hype is about. This place was not very good at all.  And I don't plan on going again.  Ever!  If I want good fish tacos, I'll go to the pros... Authentic Mexican.  I'm done!  What a disappointment!",1
"First off, know that this place is really more for take-out and delivery.  The couple tables seem more for waiting...it's really small and not particularly decorated.  But I ate here, as it was convenient.

I ordered 12 hot wings (can't get a smaller order) and 6 fried mozzarella sticks.  They give everyone their order like it's to-go, so mine came in boxes in a bag.  The wings were nice and hot...waited for them to cool down.   The fried mozzarella were good in that the cheese was nice and hot and gooey...something I could thoroughly enjoy as I ate them there.  However, the breading wasn't very tasty, and they seemed too perfectly similar to have been made there.  The marinara served with them was quite good, which would bode well for their pizzas.

The wings were flavored like Frank's Hot Sauce, with plenty of sauce.  Nice and hot in temperature, with enough meat on them, these were delish.  Most places fry their wings.  I couldn't tell for sure, as the skin had a slight crispiness, but didn't taste fried.  But I found out that they were.  

So, basically, I was impressed and will return to try their (takeout) pizza!",4
"Came here on a Saturday for dinner.. there was a wait for a table so we decided to sit at the bar for a drink until the table was ready.
Ended up ordering food at the bar and giving away our table because Emily was so cool!!
Seriously, my favorite bartender. EVER.
Attentive but not annoying.
Handled everything (being the only bartender there) very well.. timely and efficiently.

Drinks: Moscow Mule and Vietnamese Donkey
BOTH SO GOOD.

Food: Lobster Pho.. 5 stars. Delicious
Ox Tail Fried Rice: 5 stars. Really good, and actually had good chunks of meat and a yummy over easy egg on top. 
Fried calamari: big portion (we had leftovers) really good kinda spicy dipping sauce! 

Overall, 5 million stars",5
"I've been going to Hayley for years, followed her from Dizin to Habit then Habit 2 and now at Mint. Regardless of distance, she's worth it because she cares about her clients and knows hair. As a person she has a sweet disposition, and as a stylist she knows what works best, and will experiment color with you and try to ensure you have an overall positive experience. I've been doing color with her for some time, been working with purple, blue, red, teal, copper color tones, and I like that she follow-ups with you on how the color turned out and she makes fixes by buying different color products in hopes it'll last longer, that alone shows how caring Hayley is, some stylists would usually stick to products that they think is good enough but for Hayley good enough is not it, she goes for great or better. 

Hayley always takes the time to catch up with you, and is flexible when it comes to appointments. I wholly recommend you get a cut/color with her because she's great at what she does!",5
"Their pizza is always hot & fresh.  I placed on online order last week and somehow when I went to pick it up I had 3 pizza's!  I showed the confirmation email & explained I hadn't hit complete button & I went back and edited my order.  Jay was kind enough to give me those 3 pizzas for the price of one instead of throwing them away.  I thanked him and apologized sincerely.

I will continue to do the business with them ..... it's the best pizza in my opinion!",5
"Hands down, this is the BEST place for good, fresh food! If I could eat here every day, I think I would! 

They make everything in house and they are very responsible about getting their food source locally (or not too far of distance away). We picked to eat here two weeks in a row...crave worthy. We got three of their specials: baby back ribs, pork, and trout. All the dishes were cooked to perfection! What I appreciated the most was that they paired the sides so well...from risotto to horseradish mashed potatoes, to a mixed couscous. I also ordered their shrimp, andouille sausage and grits...oh my gosh, the flavor was phenomenal! 

It's definitely comfort food and you'll want to stay and ""savor"" every bite. I absolutely loved their blackberry and peach cobbler with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top! My mouth is watering...is yours?! The coffee was great too. Beer selection was good and on the night we went they were all $2. Love the specials!

The service is super friendly, yet not intrusive on your lovely dining experience. Even as we were leaving, one of the kitchen chefs was taking a break outside and he even greeted us. Just a great energy vibe...one stop here will make you a better person!",5
"I've never had Korean BBQ before but I will be back to Hobak Korean BBQ for sure. The service was excellent. Everyone was so friendly. The food was so good. I don't have a clue what exactly everything was but it didn't matter. it was all good. I was afraid the side dishes like kimchi would be too spicy for me but they were very flavorful but not spicy. Hot sauce and extra peppers were available for those who want hot.  We had the beef combo with brisket, rib eye and skirt steak. Brisket was my favorite. Now I will be looking for Korean BBQ in Portland since I only go to Vegas twice a year...",5
We sat at the bar and the hostess wrapped silverware through our entire meal next to us at the bar. The sound of the silverware clanking around in the metal container was atrocious to listen to while dining. Food was good but won't be back.,2
"This was my first time at massage nirvana. I got the intro price of $49 for a 50min massage. I brought my friend for her birthday and this was her first massage experience. We were both completely satisfied. I loved that the massage included a scalp massage. A lot of other places charge extra for that. I originally thought that I would only come here once for the cheap intro price and not come back to pay full price, but After enjoying my services I will definetely be going back!",5
High quality and fresh tasting sushi. Absolutely delicious. Wonderful and friendly service.  Beautiful and distinctive decor. Easy parking as well. Definitely my new favorite sushi restaurant in the Las Vegas area.,5
"The oatmeal cookies are baked right on site. The actual store sells beautiful household items and unique decor. They serve wonderful team either hot or cold. The owner and her daughter run the shop. They also do a lot of custom wood orders, Laser wood engraving.

A great place to come with friends your kids or family to have some tea and cookies great atmosphere very comfortable and beautiful",5
"If you don't go to Eddie V's Happy Hour (Reservations recommended, really!) and partake in the delish food and beverages then you just do not LIVE!   Where to begin.  SO, I don't really like going to The Quarter.  Parking is a bitch and it's quite a walk to get anywhere good (Eddie's does offer valet though) but we were getting Pedi's at Dolce and I wanted to take my Mom for a Spa treat and dinner.  Oh, and she was the designated driver because, have you HAD their Cosmo?  It's a triple pour Vodka for $6.00!!  And it's probably the best Cosmo I have had hands down!

Being gluten free by disease, I have to make absolute sure that both the cooks and waiter understands this.  I had an issue the previous time with a biscotti being put in my fruit dessert....but THIS visit we had Joey G. and he rocked!  We were there at 5:15 so we could dine before the very loud music began at 6:00. We shared a shrimp cocktail and each had a gluten free hot crab cake.  Great place for a celebration...but make sure you make reservations even for Happy Hour!  The place is usually full!",5
"We stayed here on our return trip from New Mexico. Staying in the suburbs of Las Vegas was a bit of a jolt after two weeks in a secluded house in the high desert, but our dog sure seemed happy to see the nice strips of manicured lawn that surround this La Quinta via a series of higher-end strip malls. 

The hotel staff were friendly, the room was clean, and everything was mostly in order. The gym equipment was wobbly (with the elliptical being dangerous in that regard) and the exercise room was a bit humid due to its proximity to the pool, but we enjoyed our break from driving and would stay again.",3
"My aunt recommended this place to me because she said this was her favorite place to get fries. I guess I should have realized that the fries probably just impressed her more than the actual seafood. I ordered the jumbo fried shrimp plate and got the fries with it. The shrimp was good but not great, the fries were really nothing special. The waitress I had was kind of weird and a bit rude even if she wasn't trying to be. The whole experience was just kind of odd.",2
Service is terrible waiting on a tow now for 90 minutes in the middle of Phoenix.  Keep providing eta and keep pushing it out.  Will cancel this service tomorrow!,1
The Good Egg was a good place for a fast breakfast.  Food was ok and the service was courteous and attentive!,3
"We had a great experience at Benihana. We didn't go in expecting anything different.  To us, it is a restaurant for specific occasions and we don't expect it to be something it is not.  We were seated right away at our reservation time, our server was excellent and attentive, and our chef, Colton, was very entertaining and seemed to really enjoy his work.  The manager came by and was very nice and friendly.  I can find nothing to complain about.  Great experience!",5
We had the bone in wings mild and a deep dish pizza. Sooooo good! The server was very nice and friendly. We will make this a regular stop.,4
"I visited this restaurant for lunch today with my team from work. I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars because I absolutely loved the inside of it and the atmosphere. The interior is so nice and unlike any other restaurant I've been inside. Very creative. I also absolutely loved the salad I had. Being that I have wheat and lactose allergies, what I can eat there is extremely limited. I ordered a salad, with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, shrimp, chicken and balsamic dressing. The salad was sooooo good. I was nice and full after I ate it.

My team members ordered pizzas and pasta dishes and those looked really good. I may try one one day.",5
"A recent work conference took me to one of my absolute favorite cities ever this past weekend, and a quick google search took me to this fabulous restaurant. I contemplated trying it for 2 days before a co-worker looking to grab dinner convinced me to test it out. I'm very glad she did.

Naturally like others - I love the concept. I've come across it several times now in my travels, but this is the first time I decided to eat at such a restaurant. You get them feel goods when you do. 

I ordered a scallop special and my co-worker had a duck special. Both were fantastic! Or so she told me on the duck because of course I didn't sample hers. I am not the biggest scallop fan, though I keep ordering it because I WANT to like them. These were the best scallops I have ever had. EVER. The succotash paired very well with the seafood as did the apple sauce tasting ... sauce atop them. Beautifully plated and amazingly delicious.

Admittedly, the service was slow. Very slow. But the food and fantastic weather (we sat outside) push me to give this restaurant five stars. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone I know visiting Charlotte.",5
"My wife was driving from Virginia City, NV to Flagstaff, AZ and planned to stop overnight in Henderson.  Unfortunately, a plastic mud guard had dislodged and was rubbing against the tire.  More unfortunately, it was midnight, so no way to get it fixed then.

She had a schedule to keep, so the only thing to do was to drive over to 5-star rated Rebel first thing in the AM and see if they could get her going.

Yep, they got her in and got her on the road again with a temporary repair.  Not only that - no charge.  Have a good day!

So of course, all our relatives in So Nev will hear about that!  Thanks Rebel Auto!",5
"I've been to WG about 5-6x and food and staff is amazing! However I went there last night and the food wasn't great, it was different apparently they got a new cook. The hummus portion was tiny, the club was completely different and the mac and cheese was completely different. Next time I'll stick to wings! I'll still return but just a bummer about the dishes not being uniform in preparation :(",3
This is simple. This is one of the best dentist's I've been to. And I hate dentist's.,5
Staff is always helpful and friendly. Good selection of items and a Great location. Highly recommend.,5
"I ended up overpaying. I went on Orbitz and got this as part of the package. I paid $15 with Orbitz and Grey Line only listed $12 for the Strip and $16 for Downtown.

But I also wished I had seen the small stack of non-impressed yelpers here before I went to Vegas. I arrived at midnight and still stood around for about half an hour to get a ride when there were 4  cars just sitting around. The ride was like sitting on public transportation. 

The return trip was the worst. I had a 3:40pm flight; they wanted to pick me up at noon. Circus Circus is only 20 minutes away from the airport. I had to kill over 3 hours at the airport when check-in and everything took half an hour only.",2
"After a few hours reading a book from the library and exercising from the local recreational center nearby you want to enjoy family time while window shopping but don't want to drive far distance and besides you want to take your family on a walk like Hollywood boulevard style in the fresh open outdoors. After walking and shopping you can eat at several of the fine dining restaurants, gamble, watch a concert or movie, this location is the place.",5
"Was craving Thai food after seeing a google doodle about pad Thai, so a group of us found Sawasdee and made a stop in. Didn't realize it was mainly delivery/takeout, but luckily we were able to claim the single table they had inside! Two people appeared to be working tonight, with one running deliveries & pickups and the other doing the register, cooking, and pickups. While they seemed plenty busy, both employees were very friendly and welcoming, with the woman apologizing for wrapping our stuff up to go before realizing we were dining in (no big deal). 

The food itself was decent - between the three of us we got pad thai w/ chicken, pad see-ew w/ chicken, and drunken noodles with tofu. The food came out pretty quickly and piping hot. The chicken was kind of dry and bland, but the noodles and vegetables were fine. The drunken noodles also got a thumbs up. 1-10 heat scale customization for each dish as well so you can get any item to your taste! This may not be our first pick for Thai food, especially if we are closer to some of the other good Thai places in the South Hills, but it's quick and friendly, and we'll definitely make another stop sometime to try out more items.",3
"I crave the Mexican pizza with chorizo. Soooo delicious.   
The seasoning on the chips is great,  too.",4
"Glad I went with my local friend's suggestion to take her here for lunch when I was in town. I am not a burger eater, but 2/3 of us were, and my food was still great anyway.

I had a customized chicken burger - gouda, mushrooms, spinach, truffled shallot aoli and it was totally delicious and NOT dry, with good flavor from the angel dust seasoning. Boyfriend had the farmer brown and enjoyed it, other friend had a custom one that she says is the best she's ever had. Upgraded to sea salt & herb fries which were well seasoned and crispy. 

We did have to wait a bit - first for the table, but we were seated quicker than promised and they text when it's ready. The burgers took a while but our waitress checked in with us, which was appreciated. Good times.",4
Starbucks will always be Starbucks! Good coffee for a high price. All worth it though!,4
"The best of the best.. my transmission was making a humming noise so I took my car to them to have it checked. To make the story short, they called the Nissan Dealership and I received a new transmission at no cost despite being a salvage car! I only paid $60 to this shop! They are very honest mechanics.",5
"So its Saturday night and the hubby and I are trying to decide what to do on Sunday morning. Hmmm where can we find sunglasses, jewelry, beauty products, live chickens and beer all in one place? Broadacres! Its like a treasure hunt every time we go. We moved here from Cali and had been missing the Santa Fe springs swap meet until we stumbled upon this place! Ahh it feels like home the smells sights and finds. Its almost a weekly thing to end up browsing the endless rows of stuff. If you get there early you get first pick but if you show up a few hours before closing on Sunday they are more willing to make a deal. So either way its a win win. The only downfall is the snack bar its over priced and just kinda gross, if you get hungry eat some bomb Mexican food at the other stands. As a matter of fact i think I'm in need of some nail polish, a lucha libre mask, and maybe live chicken or 2 too bad its only Tues. guess ill fulfill those desires come Sunday:)",4
"This place sells great bakery items. I had the chef salad. It was prepared how I like with all the veggies, meat and cheeses reduced to a fine dice. My wife had the Thai Noodle salad and enjoyed it as well. The service was friendly, and the prices are lower than what they ought to be. This school is doing positive things in our community by teaching cooking skills and techniques to students that have fallen through the cracks of our public systems. Give them a try and learn a bit about the work they are doing as you eat chef prepared food.",5
"Good work, but techs are very rushed. I asked 3 times to change my nail shape and she just kept saying keep the same, so I did. $80 later my nails were beautiful but not exactly what I wanted. Product lasted a long time and was very pretty. Make an appointment!",3
"This is the worst nail salon i have ever been to ! First of all, one of the nail techs had the WORST attitude ever. Her clients are the ones who are brining money to their business , she shouldn't be acting like that. She was talking very low i could barley hear her. I asked her if she can make my nails less pointy and she rolled her eyes. she kept on rolling her eyes. She even burned me !! I was getting acrylic nails and she burned me with the thing that spins to take off your cuticles... Also, the end product of the nails were just BAD ! She also didn't even cover my whole nail with acrylic on some fingers ! DO NOT COME HERE.",1
The best latte I have ever had in Toronto.  Plus the breakfast burritos are amazing.,5
"Had a wonderful time tonight. Met a very nice gentleman, Dominic Parisi, at the steakhouse. What a class act. Had dinner for the second night in a row (will get the sea bass again tomorrow). Thought bartender, Mel, was great!  Absolutely have fallen in love with this hotel again. Dominic would be a great V.P.!!!",5
Food is always amazing!!! Best Mexican restaurant I've eaten at service is nice but a little slow I keep going back because of the food!! :) they have only one bar which is outside in the summer time the drinks are warm... Like I said before the food is killer though so all that can get put behind.,4
The Master Spa has the best foot massage that i ever had...i am from Los Angeles.. there are many of foot massage places there...but none of them like this one..so friendly and has very good skills..especially the therapist Lin-Lin...wow..so amazing!! Definitely recommend and will come back every time i visit vegas~~~ Nothing more but A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++,5
"DO NOT LEAVE ANY PERSONAL BELONGINGS OUT,  they will disappear. I had a toiletry bag swiped while I was right there in the shower room. When I approached the front desk regarding this the response I got was as follows: "" What do you want me to tell you"". That is the kind of service you will get from the staff there. Otherwise, gym is slow paced, older crowed but some good classes and no wait on machines.",2
"The food was good, I had a bbq chicken pizza on a califlower crust. Califlower buffalo bites and chicken tortilla soup. Everything was great other than the chicken tortilla soup. It was more of a paste like out of a bag and didn't taste well.  Another thing was the price it cost me 17.50 for just the pizza which I think is quite expensive. The service we got was decent but he did take a long time to to bring our check when I ask and run my card like over 10 minutes. I had my kids with me and to me as a server I would get it quicker than that.  The food and service was not worth the price of most of the men. 

Update on review CPK reached out to me on my review and they encouraged me to post a feedback about my experience to the website.  So I did and the general manager of the chandler CPK called me. He looked into the issue and apologized. He stated he knows which waiter was it and will correct it so it doesn't happen again. He also stated that the chicken tortilla soup can get that way if it is not made right and should have not gone out that way. He was super nice and understanding about everything and offered for me to give them a second chance. He offered two free entrees. Today I went and got two califlower pizzas, one was bbq chicken and Thai peanut chicken and god they were amazing. I don't mind giving them a second chance and glad I did some times one experience doesn't define everything. The GM was great about it and he actually took my order when I went in today.
I gave them 2 out of 5 the first time and today they get a 5 Star",5
"I love this place, skinny girl margaritas are where it's at so you can use most of your calories on the stuff that matters like chips and dip. The guac is 'you need a fork because your chip is going to break its so chunky' good. I had the veggie enchiladas which I highly recommend. The only reason this place gets a 4/5 is because I only got two enchiladas and another time I got three.",4
"Joanna was amazing! Beautifully kept spa with a friendly, smiling staff. Thanks Hand and Stone Chandler!",5
"This place is great, family run and the homemade food is prepared right out in front of you. I live in Denver and visit here because of relatives in the area. I found Happys because I was looking for Internet a few years ago and sat down to eat. The service is great and very friendly and the price is very reasonable. I make it a point to come here with my dad every time I visit.",5
"Gabroy law is the best in the business for many reasons. Christian Gabroy is the BEST professional in the entire state upon employment matters for your business. His entire staff is very professional, easy to work with, and really care about the client. 10 star firm!!!",5
"Wouldn't suggest the food (had the artichoke dip that had the consistency of paste), but dude!  The drinks are amazing!!!",3
"I've been looking for a seamstress and alterations person for a while now, I took one item to start, the turnaround was fast, the price was reasonable. And she is very very nice. I'm going to start taking more pieces to her to have altered or fixed.",5
"Ok, have racked up two $100-ish casual tabs here trying basically everything, and...

The oysters are a tasty deal ($1 each for nice-sized Bluepoints) - the big question is if that's a loss-leader or if they will stay that cheap forever? And the live scallop is pretty delicious, too. Big fan of the Ponzu Salsa and the Pickled Peppers & Habañero oyster sauces (you get to pick from a list of 6 of them).

The waffle fries sound appealing, but don't get your nostalgic Chick-fil-A hopes up. They come out skinny-ish and slighly overfried. Chick-fil-A just announced their newest franchise location to be coming soon (to Henderson?) so the novelty of waffle fries shall soon be a novelty no more.

Got a bunch of other menu items, and was able to try:

The dolsot bi-bim-bap-style Pork Belly Kim Chi Fried Rice, which was disappointingly bland, underseasoned and mushy (the rice). I guess it would be a miracle to expect that this would be good here? If you've *never* had legit dolsot bi-bim-bap I can see how your mind might be blown by the hot stone pot, et al. But seeing as 13 of the 20 customers during my last visit were actual Asian Yelpers that I recognized (crazy!) they might have a hard time making this dish convincing.

The Spicy Yuzu Chicken Wings, which were relatively good - 'relatively' being the operative word - it's pretty hard to mess up fried chicken wings. The herbs and spices in the fry meal are almost KFC-like, which isn't a bad thing. But I wouldn't know they were particularly 'Yuzu' unless you told me. At about $2.50 a wing these aren't exactly a bargain. 

The Roasted Shishito Peppers: a pretty uninspired effort. There are many better versions of this around town. The roasted cauliflower that this dish came with was one of the better things we ate this time around. More of that!

Amberjack Crudo: suggested by our waitperson. A chalky taste (and aftertaste) really made this unappealing. Disappointing and $11 for about 4-5 slices. I wish I had gotten 11 more oysters instead.

Red wine by the glass ($10-$13) will start to add up. Beer is pretty reasonably priced.

Sitting in front of the oyster cabinet is a bit hard on the eyes - the fluorescent kitchen lights shine bright. Sunglasses wouldn't be out of order.

Overall, a solid effort, but *far* from mind-blowing in terms of flavor profiles. Really cool staff (which they've got!) will help this place do well. But a few nip-tucks and adjustments to the food will ensure they will become a frequent hang of those who eat out the most - twice a day, every day of the year...",3
"Never thought of this place when thinking of YELP reviews, but glad these 2 folks did to prompt me...this place is FANTASTIC!...have went here for 8 years now when I need resoling/restitching or any other small shoe problem fixed, they're quick, as mentioned honest (I've had them twice tell me they'd just be taking my money by trying to fix a problem that won't work) and charge a decent price (for Belks SOuthPark, a really great price)..EX: my wive just had an old pair of cowboy boots resoled for $25...try & find that anywhere else in town....love these folks!",5
Easily some of the best service I've ever had and it's consistently great.  Great ground crew with attention to detail.  Staff inside is very friendly and equally as great.  CAA prices for fuel.,5
"Beautiful hotel and in response to other reviews I thought it smelled fine. Rooms were clean and ready for an early check-in. The lobby was a little cold but kind of expected it since the atrium was huge. The only improvement would be to temperature check your breakfast buffet line more often, my wife said everything was cold and that was even after they brought out a fresh batch of breakfast potatoes.",4
"Wasnt worth the price, super small rooms nothing surprising, and boring puzzles. I wouldnt reccomend.

I've tried both locations downtown core and mississauga, done 3 puzzles But all are equally disappointing. 

All of the times I've been to were going with colleagues paid by my company we will no longer go to captive escape.",1
"Nuit Social is the perfect spot for a nice, romantic dinner for two. There is indoor seating and a small, enclosed patio of tables outside. If there's good weather, I suggest an outside table.

The charcuterie is where it's at and it would be a shame to leave here without. These boards can be completely customized with selections of meats, cheeses, and olives. There were sooooo many fantastic options and the staff is knowledgeable and can help you make the best selection. 

They have great options for salads and I highly recommend the Arancini, which was little fried balls of saffron rice, sausage, and smoked mozzarella. It was ridiculously good.

Their wine bottles were half off so we ordered one for the table. I'm the only wine drinker in my party so I knew I wouldn't be able to finish (or at least I shouldn't), but the server was happy to recork the bottle and allow me to take it back to my hotel. 

Charcuterie, wine, and ambiance made this such a delightful dining experience. Highly recommend!",5
I am a regular customer and I came in tonight right before closing which I normally do not do.. a young girl with blonde hair threaded my eyebrows & lip was very aggressive and it hurt ...I told her that it hurt if she could use powder and she got an attitude with me and was not concerned when I was flinching .I would not recommend going to this particular person and I will definitely only come when I see the regular faces that I've known for the past 3 years I've been going,1
First of all... With a name like mother's how could it be nothing but delicious!!! It was like food from my own (Filipino) mother. Reasonable prices and good portions. They even let you have samples of the food. Was very impressed and this is coming from someone who had Filipino food her whole life! Definitely worth the drive from north Scottsdale.,5
Omg they are so good!! Bahn mi is amazing!!! I love sandwich shops and this one is very good in my opinion.  Esp in the chandler area! Great prices too.,5
"Went here yesterday for a Summerlicious lunch with some co-workers. I love that I was able to reserve via OpenTable. Why get on the phone and talk to someone when you can click buttons at your computer? No problems with the reservation... we had a big corner table saved for the 5 of us. 

It's one of the cheapest lunch options for Summerlicious, only $15. Salted beets for app was good but not particularly memorable. Entree was a fish pie which was delicious -- very very rich and heavy. Three of us ordered it and no one was able to finish it. The pie comes with a very rich and buttery puff pastry on top. So good. 

I had no room for croissant bread pudding for dessert and changed it to ice cream/sorbet. It was all just as well because they had just run out of bread pudding and we would have had to wait another 15 minutes. 

Our server was quite friendly. Service was fast which was good because we got to get back to work on time.",4
we just walkin here for my husband and daughter's hair. We were accomodated right away.,5
"We were staying at Treasure Island so this was a great meeting place for the group we were with.  The nachos were good.  But I really recommend the fried chicken with mac and cheese and green bean casserole.  FANTASTIC!!  prob the best mac and cheese I have had,  bucket of beers are a good deal too!  My friend had the cole slaw which was one of the best slaws I've had in a restaurant",5
"I am a fan for three reasons:

1. They make EXCELLENT margaritas - I love the Jalapeno one. Their house margarita is delish too. 2. Excellent chips...and...if you ask for it, they have one of THE hottest salsas I have ever had in a restaurant! (that's my 3). My hubby says it's hotter than the ""blazing"" sauce at Buffalo Wild Wings. If you like HOT salsa, ask for it, but be careful not to take a big scoop or you will burn your tongue off.",4
"This locally-owned clothing store has a global market and it often deatured in top fashipn mags.  This place is a favorite of Greek girls and JAPS (jewish-american princesses) and the prices reflect this.  Everything is big city expensive and they have all the top brands....Seven jeans, Citzens of Humanity, L.A.M.B....a little taste of New York right on State street...just be ready to be made feel like a second class citizen if the employees don't think you've got the cash to afford their clothing.  4 stars.",4
"The Hatch burger had a fabulous taste. I recommend. They have have bottomless mimosas $16. No pulp in the orange juice which I love. I server Mike was fabulous, friendly and well attentive. I would highly recommend this off the strip gem.",5
"I saw a car online, spoke to the sales manager made an appointment to see him the next day at 6 and submitted a pre approval application. I drove an hour there to find out the car had been sold. I didn't get a courtesy call about the vehicle being sold and took me yelling at the sales manager for him to even apologize. Definitely let a sour taste in my mouth and can tell they don't care about their customers.",1
"Love this place.  Small pool and just one bar in the back but the venue itself, DJs and service all tops.  Like everything in Vegas you get what you pay for.  

I recommend Cabana 132.  Cabanas can accommodate 15 and comes with a safe, tv, AC, X-box also you can get massages",5
"Is it possible to give them zero stars??  I don't think I have ever written a downright bad review for somewhere, but here it goes.

First, there were a few smaller inconveniences: They gave us a room with one bed when we asked for two, takes a long time to find a parking spot, front desk guy doesn't really seem to know what he's doing, etc.  A bit annoying, but not the biggest deal. We also noticed our A/C unit had ice all over one side, but we were too tired to care. We checked in around 11PM and were probably asleep by 11:45 after a long day of driving.  Around 12:30 we were awakened by a loud banging from our A/C unit.  Again, annoying, but whatever.  So we flipped the unit to ""fan only"" and went back to sleep.  Around 1AM, we were awakened again by the A/C exploding.  I'm not kidding.  Loud bang.  Fire.  Sparks.  Did I mention FIRE?!  Scares you to death, and I'm sure if the bed was closer to it, injury-threatening.  In any event, the fire was put out quickly, but HERE""S THE KICKER: the front desk didn't really care!  No, ""Oh wow, sorry about that, we'll look into it.""  Just ""you can change rooms if you want.""  Yes, I want!  We waited in line for some time to change rooms (gotta love Vegas), and they switched us rooms, but after that fiasco though, we just couldn't sleep and decided around 2AM to just leave, and... THEY WOULDN""T GIVE US A REFUND!!!  Really?!  No refund?  We were there less than 3 hours, most of which time was spent dealing with their mess ups and defending ourselves from demon A/C units.  Wow.  Obviously something we should pay full price for, right?!

Simply put, don't stay here.  Unless everywhere else is full.  And then maybe just drive to Mesquite or sleep in a gutter somewhere.",1
"Hands down best bbq restaurant in the entire state of Arizona !!!!! All meats were cooked to perfection, macaroni w/ brisket, delicious!  Mean greens, amazing!  Baked beans, marvelous! & the dry rub wings blew our minds! This is a must go for all Phoenix residents & those here visiting!",5
"FIFA World Cup jerseys for 2014 and 2018 can be found here! I called other soccer stores around town and they didn't have both, mostly just 2018 jerseys. 

The 2014 jerseys are 50% off while the 2018 jerseys are 30% off! Great finds I even looked online for the sizes I wanted new and couldn't find them.

The associates were very helpful and informed me that their 2014 FIFA World Cup jerseys were actually stored in the back since 2014 but they pulled them out to put next to their 2018 FIFA World Cup merchandise - amazing. I'm glad they had some leftover. But definitely call ahead to see if they have your team/country and your size.",5
"Of all the department stores I've ever been in, this is the lamest! The selection of clothes is not very good and the staff ignores you. Pretty disappointing!!!",2
"Michael's has been around forever...I've eaten more sundaes here than I care to admit.  And, without fail, they are good. Every. Single. Time. Yes, they are a bit pricey.  Yes, they may be small for what you get. Yes they are all pretty similar. But darn it. They are so stinkin' good.  Just eat them before they melt, because gosh does custard melt faster than ice cream!!

I have never eaten the ""real"" food at this location - so I can't comment on that. But the sundaes are worth it every time.",4
"These guy's were at the Chandler Ostrich Festival 2010.
My daughter wanted a smoked turkey leg, big belly's bbq were the only vendor that was selling smoked turkey legs. So I decided to go ahead and get one for her. I waited in line, paid for my order ($10 for one leg) and started waiting in another line...

Little did I know that these people were accepting money for product that wasn't even cooked yet. 40 minutes later with about 30 people behind me, I finally got the leg. We walked to the stage at this event, took our seats and I noticed that my 11 year old daughter was barely even picking at it. I asked her why she wasn't eating and she gave me a lame excuse...

Now my daughter is a healthy eater, but she also doesn't like to complain. (She also realized that we had waited almost an hour for the turkey to finish cooking and didn't want to be a pain)

I decided to try some of it.

It was moist, but it tasted awful. Sort of like a combination of raw egg and raw poultry.
 
By this time I was pretty pissed, not only had I wasted 10 dollars on sub-standard meat, but also 45 minutes of my time!

I really wanted to see the band that was playing since that was the main reason we went. (http://www.wartheband.com/home.html)
After they were finished playing I took the leg back and they just blew me off as though I was trying to rip them off.

The bottom line is that  these people cannot seem to handle large events or even maintain a consistent product.
 Keep that in mind the next time you have any remote urge to hire these people. 
Horrible food, horrible customer service, but they will gladly take your money.",1
When this place opened up there was a line out the door and around the building for days. So today i drove by to see if they still had lines out the door and they didn't so I decided to go in for lunch and try it out.  It's average. It's good. I would never stand in line for this place ever.  It's very expensive for what you get.  Bacon cheese burger small fry and small drink was $14 and the burger was very small. It was good but very small. For this price I will go over to Duckworths and get a much larger burger and tastier in my opinion.,3
"Vegan selection ""The Soho"" is to die for!

It's inexpensive, the staff is meh and it's located inside The Plaza Hotel in Downtown Las Vegas.",4
I go to this Starbucks when I am at work on my breaks to eat. The workers are super nice even under pressure. Great group of workers!,5
"For a small, family, independently-owned jeweler, they have the largest collection of engagement rings we have seen.  Ken and Kathy do a terrific job getting to know your tastes and preferences and matching up them up to ring selections.  They also give their personal opinions about each of the ring designers, which I appreciate.  They are so patient, and their follow-up is exceptional.  Excellent.",5
"Four stars from a guy...not bad, huh?

They had a pretty good selection and a lot of good deals on their inventory.

Their customer service was very good, and they were very helpful and down to earth...not something you see a lot of at higher end shops in Vegas.

The lady ended up with some good deals, and lucky for me, the store isn't big enough to spend the day at, because given the chance I know she would.",4
"What a cute location. Its very simple and rustic. 

A tasting is only ~6bucks and you get 9 different wines. The prices are very good and around 12 bucks a bottle. You can also buy accessories from the shop.

Something different about this place is that they have wine slushie mixes and they were outstanding.",5
"I got me some Paper denim jeans on sale here for $45, an English Laundry tee and some Donald J Pliner shoes for half off - and ever since I was hooked. 

Roka is a small mens/womens boutique in the Arrowhead AJ's shopping center - heavy on the denim with shirts, sweaters, belts and shoes.  The owners are friendly and offer guests water and candy when you're shopping (or maybe it's just me).   Every so often they'll have a steal of sale - including their denim sales in February.

Who says you have to hoof it to Scottsdale for fancy duds?",4
"My mom and my son and I went to old town on a Thursday to check out some galleries and listen to some of the buskers! So after our perusing we stopped to get ice cream. 

Real ice cream! Petersen's is a really cool place and it's brand new! Just opened 11/23 I think. Well they have lots of great flavors like Georgia Peach, NY Black Cherry, Cappuccino, Peppermint with real peppermint, lots of sorbet, lots of chocolate stuff that I didn't want to try, and old favs like cookie dough, butter pecan etc. 

They also sell pints and also gallons I think! 

The staff is super cool and well educated about the history of the shop. I think the girl said they originated in Chicago and that the tiles in the ceiling are from the original location! I just thought that was so cool! She also said that they could sub the milk in your lattes and coffe with ice cream to make pepperment lattes and more wild flavors! I thought that was pretty rad. 

Anyway, if you are in old town I highly recomend you check this place out!",4
"So not good. What a waste of my time and money. 
My friend and I are from NYC and we were looking for a place to have thai food and listen to thai music or thai karaoke. Before we went to the restaurant we called and asked them if they had any sort of entertainment and they said yes, they start at 12:30-1am. We arrived at 2 am and there was no entertainment at all, just regular music on the radio. That was the first disappointment. 
The food was horrible. I'm Thai and this place does not do Thai food justice. Not authentic, even if you're going for Americanized thai food it still wasn't good. The grilled beef was so dry and the sauce was just not right. The papaya was too sweet, I like my food to be on the sweet side so if I say it was too sweet you know it was. Everything else was just bland. My friend also ordered a soup which we never got. The waitstaff was friendly but they were coordinated with each other. Service was kind of all over the place.  
In a nutshell just don't go. Kung fu across the street is a much better option for thai food.",1
"Wow... breakfast was so good! Your omelette was spectacular, the biscuit and gravy was very very good, love their coffee and a plus is they had real half-and-half and sweet and low!! We will definitely be back",5
"Good bar/restaurant combo. Pretty girl behind the bar with a great can do attitude.  Farmhouse burger with sweet potato fries was very good. Egg cooked perfectly.  They have a bunch of craft beer on tap. I was here for lunch so I didn't partake in the alcoholic beverages. 
Private rooms for parties is a great addition to the place.",4
"so, after a lovely walk at Robbin's Butte Wildlife Area, we hit up Tomo for our Valentine's Day supper.

unfortunately, the service was sub-par, to put it nicely. when we arrived, we were seated promptly; however, when the waitress came by for our orders(about 10 minutes later), we told her we'd need another minute. well...10-15 minutes ticked by, as we watched several more tables seated, and a couple of orders taken.

finally, a different waitress came by and took our orders. Jamie had the fried cream cheese jalapenos, and the Spicy Crunch roll, while I ordered the edamame(to share), the Hibachi Seaweed Salad, and the white tuna carpaccio.

Jamie's orders came within a reasonable amount of time, as did the edamame. I had to wait considerably longer for the salad(a big disappointment; a lump of greasy seaweed on top of a huge pile of oily lettuce), and my carpaccio came out 20 minutes or so after Jamie had finished his second course. completely unacceptable. Jamie also had to stop the waitress to ask for his soda to be refilled, after she walked past his empty glass several times.

the one bright point? my carpaccio was fresh and delightful. I ordered it with the sauce on the side, which was definitely a good idea, as it was pure sesame and chili oils, and the spice and oil would have swamped the delicate flavor of the fish itself.

we'll return, but only in the middle of a non-holiday weekday, hoping for much better service than we received this past Monday.",3
"Loved this place! Went for lunch. And had the Bianca with sausage. The pizza came out really quickly and was hot. Loved that they have not only grated parm and pepper flakes, but also hot oil. I also asked for a side of sauce (my pizza didn't have it on it) and they brought some with no problem. The space is bright and really welcoming, and the people are friendly. Will definitely be back!",5
Nami's brunch on Sunday and breakfast all other days are the bomb. I love their Acai and Quiche during the week. Sunday brunch is a completely different menu and always has a special. All I can say is Nami is a special place.,5
"Came here with the fam here for the first time from my bro's recommendation.  It was great.  The Ahi Tuna Sandwich was super delicious.  My bro had the Fontina Burger and said that was great too.  I order the BBQ pulled pork and that was OK...probably can get the same at any BBQ joint (probably won't order that again...nothing special). The regular fries were just regular...if you come might as well upgrade to garlic or sweet potato fries.  We also got the salmon salad and that was good.  Set up was nice, always a line, but moves quicker than I thought.  There's seating inside and outside...luckily it was cloudy today so it wasn't too bad.  Probably would only come here in the evening or not come during the summer.  Service was great and nice.  Will come again for sure!!!",5
"Ok before I get started, I want you all to know that I'm very fair when I rate someone for their services. I always put my feet in their shoes.....this  time is not the case. I had a need to purchase 4 boxes of coffee the one that comes in a half-gallon I believe. Due to the previous experience at a different location, I decided to call in first, I gave them 30 minutes before I came to the store. When I got there, realized I didn't have enough cash, so I went to the ATM, when I headed back I paid for my invoice and stood there waited for 10 minutes. I am not complaining about the wait time here, because I understand they had to brew the coffee and it wasn't just a cup or two, they were 40 cups of coffee equivalent. So I waited and waited, apparently they were ready for me by the counter more than 10 minutes ago and no one tells me. I had to take the initiative to ask. What irks me was the manager just acted like, well, if they are yours, you can take them. What the....? really? I just felt half of the employees at this store could careless about their customers. I just hope that their jobs will last here. Higher management needs to pay some attention here period.",1
"Quality food and a really good size for the price. Paid around $18 for a really decent sized pizza with good ingredients. Cute interior, good service.",5
"Um Caliente SERIOUSLY!?!

So after work I decided to order a pizza a pie. Nothing too crazy. A Red Pizza by my definition is a pizza with red sauce on it. Apparently, not this time. Anywho I ordered a Red Pizza with Parmesan on the side and garlic sauce.

I received: Cheese with extra red sauce. No Parmesan, and some weird sauce with green stuff in it maybe it cilantro/basil I don't know. Plus it was undercooked! Thats kind of a trifecta of badness by my definition. I dont know. I would like to say this was the first time I've received an undercooked pizza which I had to send back but alas it is my third.

Caliente, whats going on?!?! I'm confused, bewildered, baffled even. Step your game up or else Giovanni's is more than welcome to take my money anyday.",1
"Isn't it just typical of Verizon to have sent me this reply to this review last week, only to not reply to me like they said they would. And since customer service is one of major nits with these people, for me, the ball is in their court, which they have failed to return:

""I am very concerned about your experience with our company Chris! I apologize for the inconvenience you had with your upgrade as well as the service! Allow me the opportunity to restore your confidence in Verizon Wireless. You deserve the best customer service and I am here to give that to you! I would like to address your concerns with the dropped calls and provide you information about your upgrade. Please reply back with your full name and mobile number. I will contact you to better assist!""

I gave them my name and number last week, and have not heard back from them. And, I'm not going to go chasing a lame duck. And, now that I read that Verizon donates millions of our dollars to political special interests (which don't have OUR best interests at heart), it just keeps nailing the coffin shut for me. Yes, other big name mobile communications companies use their huge profits for political influence, but almost everything about the way Verizon does business, and fails in its service approach puts them at the bottom of the list behind AT&T , T-Mobile, etc. These companies are dominating our lives because they know, or figure upon the fact that we can't do without our mobile devices. But, what if we all took that power back, and formed a union, and jumped ship en masse? We would bring them to their knees. Who's with me?

And hey, Verizon, how about no more mandatory software ""upgrades"" that actually slow my phone down and mess it up, with lost settings, that simply pisses me off! And, when will my phone ring when the ringer is turned on? Should I ask for a rebate check for the myriad of lost and deferred calls--some which have cost me a potential client? And, are you going to make good on your promise of a free upgrade to iPhone4S, or was that all golden carrot-dangling mularkey?

Update: 8/19 -The customer service rep who responded below, just like the last person, asked for my info to get right back to me with, and of course, never did. Or, maybe she tried, and the phone never rang, being Verizon. I think I am going to sue Verizon for all my money back + damages. $97 x 20 months = $1,940. Anyone want to start a class action suit with me?",1
"We were expecting the worst when it was time to go mattress shopping but these guys made it so easy. Jonathan and Toni helped us without making us feel pressured. We told them what we wanted (firm, no foam) and our budget and they had us try a few specific models to get the feel of different types. They explained the different construction options without getting pushy. We found one we loved that was even slightly under budget and was a spring/foam hybrid. Did not even know that was an option! Then they had a touchscreen in the store showing all of Levin's frames and offered us to take a look. We easily could have said no... had already seen a frame from Costco we were planning to buy. But figured why not see what Levin had.. and sure enough, there was a model just like what we wanted. Long story short, they were able to beat Costco's price on the frame. Combined with the under-budget mattress, we came up with a nicer bed for a few hundred dollars less than we planned to spend. 
Fast forward to delivery. Our mattress/frame combo was out of stock so we had to wait a few weeks. Finally delivery was scheduled for a 3-hr window. The guys showed up slightly before the start of the window and were gone within 30 minutes. Awesome. 
After a month of sleeping on this bed we could not be happier. People will give you all kinds of unsolicited advice on living a good life but I'm telling you... all you need is a good king bed to feel like you've really arrived.",5
"This place is really amazing! The manager can tell that we are new to the place so just gave us arancini for free! It is really tasty and feel like home food! I also had gyro. The meat was so tender but perhaps a little bit saltier than my taste. My friends had souvlaki and veal burger, the portion is huge! Also the service is great! I will definitely come back again.",5
"Deeeelish! The store was a little hard to find due to the Scottsdale Road numbering switcheroo at the Tempe/Scottsdale border. Very high quality. I like that they carry Quest Bars and they had my favorite flavor in stock. The staff wasn't friendly or not friendly, just doing their job.",4
Olga is the sweetest and I love that she explained the purpose. She was really flexible too because I had a last minute thing come up and she was able to reschedule me and my mom the next day. Our lashes are beautiful!,5
"So most of the reviews we read showed how the Flamingo was a bad hotel. I beg to differ. We got a great rate for room and flight through Vegas.com $236 for a flight and hotel for 2 nights, 3 days. We weren't expecting much for the room, because who stays in there room in Vegas anyways?

POOL: Why we chose the Flamingo, THE POOL! The GO pool is totally worth the stay. There is one major big pool with a waterfall and there is a small pool towards the entrance. The upstairs area pool is for kids and families. There are palm trees in the water and there is a small lagoon area. Dancers come out at around 11 - 12:00 PM noon to dance while trendy tunes are blasting around. They have happy hour specials from 8 to 12 PM. $20 bucket of beer (5) and $5 bloody marys and Coors Light cans. There is a grotto, several drink stands and servers that walk around to take orders of food and drinks. We ordered a chicken quesadilla and chicken tenders and were super happy with the taste and portions. Can't complain here. You are not supposed to bring in food or drink. They will allow coffee and water. Yes, things are a bit expensive in regards to drinking at the pool. Their collective flamingo cup with slushy alcoholic beverage runs about $22. Get there at 8:00 AM when the pool opens, so you can get a good seat, otherwise you won't find one and you will have to lay your towel out by the pool and sit. Cabanas get booked fast. Daybeds are $249. Not sure how much lounge chairs are. Think you can book ahead on the cabanas, possibly online. NEED YOUR ID and ROOM KEY TO get into the pool, so plan ahead! Towels as you walk in. 

ROOM: We arrived around 11:00 PM. We asked for an early check in. It would have been $30, which isn't a big deal. But the lady asked us if we wanted an upgrade for $20 and she would wave the early check in rate. SOLD. Our room overlooked Caesar's Palace. The beds had white sheets and covers with a pinkish furry thing at the end of our bed. There were two Flamingo property photographs that were trendy on the walls. The couch was grey with pink trimming and our view was great. We were pleased with what we had. Yes, the bathroom looks a bit dated, but everything was functional and clean. Again, you shouldn't be in your room, so we were happy with the location on the strip and our view. The Flamingo is a great location on the strip. You can easily get to Caesar's and its about a 10-15 min walk to Bellagio and the Paris. About a 20 min walk to Cosmopolitan and Aria. Taxi cab rides to Cosmpolitan or Aria were about $10. Split the costs with your friends and you are saving a lot more money. Amenities like coffee, shampoo/conditioner in one, soap. TV was fine and the AC worked very well. 

TIP: If you have a total rewards card, you go into check in a lot quicker. We bypassed 100 guests by going into the Total Rewards line for check in. CHA CHING! If you don't have one, go over to the Total Rewards desk, get your Total rewards card and then go check in. You'll save time. Also, your Total Rewards card will get you discounts here and there on Harrah's properties (Harrahs, Flamingo, the Quad, Caesar's, Ballys etc) 

Paradise Buffet: We were planning on going off the strip for lunch, but we were at the Flamingo and saw a buffet. We paid $30 but added on a $9.99 all you can drink beer, wine, bloody marys, mimosas deal. The buffet was typical with prime rib, shrimp, chicken, pasta, salad, mac and cheese and lots of desserts. I drank my $9.99 mimosas and beers and had a great buzz going on! So, if you sit there for awhile and drink, you'll get your moneys worth, especially since all the casinos charge so much for drinks. Of course you could sit at a machine or gamble and stock up, but that could get expensive. So remember that many of the Harrah's properties have the $9.99 all you can drink option for their buffets, expect for Caesar's Bacchanal buffet.

Casino Payoffs: Pretty good. I had luck here. Played Star Wars, played Sex and the City and the Hangover and won money, so I'm a happy camper.

There are Flamingos as the pool, real live ones. Saw a lot of people eating at a pizza bar located by the Paradise buffet. Looked and smelled delicious. A reasonable price to stay at a central location. They have renovated areas and rooms, so give it a try. Again, dont compare it to Bellagio, Encore, Wynn or the new places. If you want to save some money, stay here.",3
"Outstanding food, great service and a wonderful atmosphere. They get very busy and don't take reservations but they make up for that having an advanced automated txting system which allows you to do anything within 10 mins, once they txt you that it's time to be seated, you have 10mins to show up.",4
"Pretty standard for a British/Irish pub, with a younger more raucous crowd. This pub has Kronenbourg Blanc on tap, which deserves a resounding thumbs-up. The server was very friendly, and after mentioning YYC Pizza Week, the manager came out and chatted about their creation. The pizza was great and packed a nice punch, but the apple cobbler wasn't to our tastes. Another solid neighbourhood pub in the suburbs, with a good vibe and good intentions.",4
"I have been here previously and had their acai bowl, and it was just awesome. I came back to try out their poke bowls, but was a little disappointed. You are given the option of choosing your base (cabbage, rice, or spring mix salad) and then you choose your poke. I ordered the spicy shoyu with the cabbage. They messed up my order and gave me the bowl with spring mix instead, which was fine just a little disappointing. The sauce that came with it was also overly salty to the point where I had to completely avoid the sauce after a while. BUT the poke itself was extremely fresh and good quality, as were all the other ingredients. We mentioned the mix up after and they gave us a card to get a free acai bowl next time, so they were very nice about it.",4
"Arrived on time, completed a difficult repair which involved access through a narrow crawl space, left behind a clean job site.  Have used Stevens many times over the years and will continue to do so.  Always on time; always professional.",5
"Awsome. Wiped everything down! Friendly staff, loved coming home to a clean house. Stove, fridge, showers, toilets, floors, cupboards, sinks, carpets. Even maid my bed, I never make my bedwell worth the money and i am having them back once a week to keep it clean.",5
"I used to love the burritos at the restaurant on College, so when we were passing by this place,we stopped for dinner. I had the 2/$10 quesadillas - I got 1 pulled pork (AMAZING!), 1 chicken (also very tasty).  I found the sizes good, and there was lots of stuff inside (rice, beans, cheeeeeeese).  I liked the homemade chipotle sauce. My friend got the beef burrito and said it was really good.  We split an order of guacamole & chips, and OMG the guac!  
Menu had some good vegan options too, so I'm bringing my picky vegan friend next!
Overall, I'd recommend.  The place was clean, comfy and the food was exactly as awesome as I'd hoped.",5
"There's not many places that legitimately take walk ins, as in say yes and work on you in a timely manner. I managed to get myself and my sister into Envy for pedicures and they started working on us right away. After soaking our feet, we were both treated to some really awesome foot massages that involved hot stones!

I asked for shellac polish, so I was brought away from the pedicure chairs to the manicure stations and she started painting away. I wish the other technician had started my sister pedicure while I was getting mine because I ended up having to wait for hers well after mine was good and done.

No other complaints from me though, they did a good job and price was competitive to the surrounding salons.",3
"They have deffinately gotten better, I know I said I woukd never be back but I've come a couple times, once because my mom told me they have corned beed hash (not the canned stuff like most places) so I gave it a try and omg it was amazing, so a few months after that ot was a late night and I really wanted some of that corned beef again so u came here and they totally changed up the menu and don't have my corned beef late night anymore!! I was dissapointed about that but they did have decent food still so I wasnt too upset lol I would be back anytime of the day because even tho they don't still have my corned beef the food is good and the service has gotten a lot better than before :)",4
Tiffany B is a GOD !!!!!!....extremly professional and friendly.....Artist beyond words....Will not stop working on your until she feels it's perfect....,5
"I needed a factory re-set on my iPad and arrived right when the store opened

I was second in line for tech support and waited for about 15 minutes

Nolan was my tech and he was amazing! Very helpful and accommodating! He was able to answer all of my questions and concerns around having to re-set to factory settings. From entering the store and walking out with a refreshed iPad it took 45 minutes-way less time than I thought it would be.

The store is a well oiled machine and Nolan is a gem!",5
"I went here once to check it out. Unfortunately, I probably won't be going back. I'm all for healthy food and would like more options when it comes to area restaurants but for me, Zoe's didn't cut it. Looking over the menu I decided upon the chicken pita. The food came quick enough, I think there was only one other patron in the place at the time. Anyways, the chicken was bland and flavorless. Hello, taste? Where are you? The pita bread was just as bad, it fell apart within moments. The only saving grace was the caramelized onions. A nice touch although not enough to save this meal. The pita came with a side of your choice (I opted for the pasta salad, pretty disappointing) and a bag of potato chips. Whatever. I thought this was supposed to be healthy eating? The decor reminded me of a fast food place in Europe: very colorful and bright. Perhaps one day in the future I may try Zoe's again, but for now two stars seems more than appropriate.",2
"We ate here before a show on my first trip to Vegas.  I loved it.  Sweet Potatoes Au Gratin was tasty. Loved the ""house"" margarita.  I am not one for spicy food but my salmon was the right kind of spicy. Had a kick but didn't kill my taste buds so I could not taste anything else.  My sister had the tenderloin and that was good. My husband had the filet and surprisingly he thought it was a bit too spicy for him. (I hardly ever hear him say that.)  Great service. We enjoyed our evening.",4
"One of the worst meals I've had in a long time. Tuna was ordered medium rare, came out medium well. Pasta WAY overcooked. Do not need to ever come back. Plenty of other restaurants on Mt Washington.",1
"I will have to attach my photo. We had a blast in this place it was soooo much fun. The customer service was so awesome, we had them get things down from up high and with out a grunt or groan and a smile they got it down for us. They were so helpful.",4
"I went in today to pick up a to go order and boy am I glad I found this place. I tried the Ma Po tofu and sesame chicken and it was sooooooo good, and the portions are huge. My boyfriend and I couldn't finish it. Also if you order $15 or more you get a free soda can, which was pretty neat. I highly recommend this place and cant wait to try more!",5
"Check your bill!  

SO and I had a dim sum lunch together.  Food was ok, but the selection was challenging.  They were pushing the fried foods and noodles.  We were looking for more steamed dim sum items.

We noticed several tables around us that had more items show up on their bill than they thought they ordered.  Keep an eye on our check-off list.  The servers attempt to keep it facing away from you.  Make sure the count lines up with your expectations as you go.  

We did not have that problem.  We got to the checkout and the lady actually placed a different amount on the credit card machine that our bill added up to.  It seemed like this was not an accident - when we noticed, she ignored our complaints.  CHECK THE BILL - NOT TRUSTWORTHY.",2
This is such a great chill spot. Parking is easy to find. Staff is friendly. They greet you you right when you come in. I love the decor. Very rustic and clean. My husband and friends got their selections of beer and they were all happy with the pricing. They also have some snacks you can purchase. We were here for a few hours and the service was great. We will definitely come back.,5
"If you like strong delicious drinks, you have to make a purchase here. Their selection is all about quality, not quantity. The ingredients are fresh and the drinks are made to order by friendly knowledgeable bartenders. This little gem is part of our ""Tour of the Strip"" for our friends and family. So far, they all want to go back for more.",5
I'm a fan for spending under thirty dollars and I leave with five full bags of veggies and fruits.  Cheap buys here.  I also come here to buy tara root (malanga) and (platano) (if you know what I mean).,4
"Ok, not great. My campus cobb salad was made with lukewarm greens and an avocado that wasn't  fresh (it had been sealed in plastic who knows how long ago). I prefer fresh crisp greens and fresh avocado. Otherwise, it was ok.",3
"They definitely have a unique dining experience. I tried their scallops, albacore sashimi, carrot cake and I must say I was impressed! The ambiance here is great I have no complaints. Highly recommend trying this place out.",5
"I have been to red lobster many times. Sometimes the food is great but sometimes it's subpar. Currently, the crabfest is going on at re lobster. My husband and I decided to visit and enjoy some crab. We ordered Alaska bairdi crab, stuffed mushroom with seafood and crab cake dinner. Now, I hate sides available at red lobster. They should include an option to add soup as a side or have some better tasting side options. Now, coming back to the food, stuffed mushrooms tasted really nice. They had good stuffing of seafood. Alaska bairdi crab tasted sweet and fresh. Crab cakes tasted really great and I was happy that they had crab lump meat not shredded. We were so happy with our meal that we went again next week. I again ordered crab cake dinner for myself, my husband ordered fresh whole lobster from fresh fish list and sweet chilly shrimp. Sweet chilly shrimps had too much oil in them. I felt as if I'm drinking oil. They did not taste nice. Crab cake was ok as this time crab meat was shredded and was a little bit dry. Lobster was overcooked and was so rubbery that my husband couldn't even cut it with knife. We told our server about the lobster and she immediately called her manager. She offered us to replace it. But our food already had come so late and we were getting late for the movie so we declined the offer. She informed us that she will adjust the bill accordingly. My husband had just taken two bites of pretty expensive lobster. When the bill came, we realized that they took off 50% off from the lobster dish. We still felt bad, as we did not have eaten even 20% of that dish. Anyways, first experience was good but second was a disaster.",3
"Recently discovered how close this food lion was to me . Overall nice store clean and friendly staff ! I can easily find things as I am familiar with the layout of most food lions . I have had large shopping trip here yet but when I want find more grocery like
Items cheaper than target I will come here .",4
"Our vacation was this July 3-7, 2017. We arrived very late. 1am on the 4th. The weather, was great. 100+ every day. I love the heat the hubby not so much. We were not able to check in until 4 pm. So we went to another hotel for the night. The Best Western down the strip was able to accommodate us immediately. And for the same price.  The next day we finally checked in at the Flamingo and went to our room. It was a king bed. There was a great view of the pool from the tenth floor. I also liked that they did not have carpeting. The room seemed to be renovated recently.  Although, my husband thought the lamps were from the 60's. Lol. We did not spend a lot of time in room except to shower and sleep. There were a few things that needed attention though. 

The bathtub faucet continually ran. Not dripped but ran. We put a towel in the tub so we did not hear the constant drops.  The wallpaper above the window was peeling in the corner. The lightbulb in the bathroom was not working. I couldn't figure out why it was so dark. Until the second day. The drain in the sink was very slow going down. My biggest concern was the outlet next to the bed appeared to have a prong broke off in it. I did inform the clerk when I was checking out. I told him it may be a fire hazard. He did note that in the checkout notes. But nothing else. 

When you stay here, at least in our room, there is no refrigerator there is no microwave   You need to pay for the shuttle to and from the airport, about $7 a person. That is about the same as a cab. 

It is a beautiful hotel.the only problem with walking the casino or going sightseeing is the people who stop you constantly to purchase shows and stuff. It gets really pushy at times. If I wanted tickets I would get the or ask how to get them. It's not just in the casinos or hotels it's everywhere. The one concierge was extremely helpful  was named Ron. The self check in kept telling us to see the clerks. He was able to explain what we needed. 

You can also check your luggage before check in if you are early. Then , they will deliver it to your room when you get there. The people working the luggage check in were great. Very helpful. Gave recommendations for sites and where to eat. 

Would I stay there again? Probably, if I went with my brothers who are high rollers. They get comps and upgrades all the time. This was our first time. My daughter gave us a tip, to get the three day bus pass. Unlimited ridding. Use the phone App. You will need to update every day the app. 
Even with the bus pass I logged 15 miles on my Apple Watch for three days.",3
"I'm only giving it a 4 star because of the relatively high prices. But once that's out of the way, you'll have a good meal there.

The ambiance was good, and service was excellent, but that's what you'd expect from a 5-star hotel. Now, onto the food!

I had the Japanese Breakfast Bento box ($36) the morning I arrived at the MO and it was good, albeit pricey for what was offered. The grilled salmon and shrimp dishes were delicious, as were the mushroom and tofu dish. But be warned! If you hate sour food, don't eat the pickled plum! I made such a face from having it that made the server walk over and ask if there was anything wrong.

Every Sunday, they offer a brunch buffet at $58 per person. Again, if not for the price, it would be 4.5-5 stars. You'll be offered a menu to order your ""main"" brunch entree--I had an Indian curry and my girlfriend had the salmon omelette. The curry was delicious and tasted authentic, and the salmon omelette was delicious as well. You have multiple options for the buffet: a fresh made noodle soup bar, a couple of dim sum dishes, a sushi/sashimi station, and a raw seafood bar with oysters, shrimp, and crab claws, an d of course the dessert station. There are also salads, cured meats and cheeses, and fresh fruits if that's more your thing. The sushi was fresh and delicious (they had salmon, tuna, and yellowtail during my visit), and I had a delicious soba noodle soup at the soup station. The dessert station doesn't disappoint, and the seafood tasted fresh as well. The best part? Your server will bring you freshly made Mochi ice cream at the end of your meal! I'd known earlier so I could've had more!",4
"First, it's a buffet so it's not the best food you can buy. I'm giving it 5 stars in comparison to buffets in general and other relative factors.

We went in at 3pm and it was $9 per adult till 4pm. We thought the offering might be thin due to the time but they had everything. The place is not that big and the furnishings, decor and restrooms are well worn and tired. The service, well, it's a Chinese buffet so don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. 

The food was salty as expected but still pretty good. They were placed in small trays and rotated often. Everything seemed fresh and nothing was terrible. Overall, we were pleasantly satisfied and stuffed ourselves appropriately. 

Resist the urge to go for the oysters on the half shell and crab legs they start bringing out at 4pm for the dinner menu and you won't have the rude experience of having the manager come to your table to tell you that you'll get charged the full dinner price of $13. A woman at the table next to us nearly got into an argument over that one. And, skip the soda. It's a buffet for Pete's sake! Whattaya doin' getting filled up on soda and paying extra for it?!",5
"Terrible customer service ! Please save yourself time and energy and stay away from this company. Flew in to PHX at 11:30 pm on Sunday, had confirmed 3 times with the company the pick up time, no one showed up. Tried to call the company 10+ times no one picked up the phone. I was stuck at the airport at midnight without a way of getting home, thankfully I was able to get a cab an hour later. The next day I email the company saying what happened at this is what I got in return : 
""sorry that happened to you because we have 700+ very satisfied customers.   You obviously had an unfortunate experience, but that does not represent the entire company.  We have removed you from our database.
Lajolla Express""
Really ? That's how they take care of their customers, by removing you from their database .... 
Avoid this company !",1
"I am giving 3 stars but only because the woman at the front desk was quite nice and gentle. I should give it 1 star really because they break all sorts of HIPPA laws. This was particularly true of the male tech who was doing a lot of workplace and court ordered drug testing and openly calling their names and discussing what people were there for so loudly that everyone in the waiting area heard. 

One gentleman was there for a court ordered drug test and not only was he openly discussing this with the woman in front for all of us to hear but at one point described the man as difficult and was asked by her if he was going in and he said not yet. Basically there was absolutely no privacy. 

This same male tech also came to the door where 3 of us were standing and abruptly slammed the door on us and said, ""WE ARE CLOSED UNTIL NOON"". 

There is absolutely no HIPPA laws observed here whatsoever. I am glad I was there for medical reasons as I did not really care who heard why I was there but if I had been so inclined I likely would have gone to my car and cried.",3
Fun. If you like musicals and evil dead and rocky horror this is for you! It's reasonably priced. If you do VIP and get a shot with your ticket that's pretty cool and general admission isn't bad seating. The theatre is clean and staff is all tommy winds family and they are all working hard to keep the place open. I enjoyed the show because I like musicals and evil dead. It's a niche market for a show but fun!,4
So much fun. Come early to avoid crowds and to secure a spot to chill out when you're not enjoying the pools and slides. Not a huge park and not state of the art but still a lot of fun. There are rental lockers for $7. Food and beverages are overpriced but that's not out of the norm for amusement parks. Free parking! Teens may become bored after a couple hours. Like to surf? You can on the Waves in the Wave Pool after 5pm. (double check with the park before you go in case they've changed their policy),4
"Oh El Hefe... it has become one of our new spots to be at all the time.  Its not that the food or drinks are extraordinary but its just the place to be for the moment.  The atmosphere is a lot of fun.  The staff is really friendly and 80% of the time really attentive.  However, it is a very busy place at times so you gotta give them a break.  I've always had a great time here.  Beergaritas are a good deal.  Happy hour and sundayfundays are the best.",4
"We had a pipe  break and flood our kitchen and into another room.  We shut the water off and called Robins the next day.  We received prompt service and the service tech was very efficient, knowledgeable and polite. Initially my insurance company denied my claim and Robins wrote up a work order and explanation of the problem and faxed it to the insurance company who then reversed their decision and covered my claim.  I would definitely recommend this company to anyone looking for a good reliable plumber.",5
"Italian comfort food at its finest in a casual but upscale environment. My family recently enjoyed a trip to Montreal and we indulged in lots of haute cuisine. On our last night we just wanted a nice big meal (you know how some of the very high end restaurants can leave you hungry due to small portions). We actually canceled our dinner reservations at a very high end restaurant and opted to come here instead for some down to earth food. The restaurant is gigantic and we didn't have to wait to be seated. We enjoyed the free hot bread and pesto/olive oil dip along with a Caesar salad, caprese salad, osso bucco, spaghetti carbonara, and fettuccine with vodka sauce. The service was very friendly and attentive. We did not feel rushed in any way. We left feeling full and happy. I highly recommend it for a casual but delicious meal with great service.",5
"I have been coming to this DQ for my frozen milky sugar for years, and I have also been insisting that my children and their friends order their treats with an accent or they don't get any.  Literally 10+ years, I've been subjecting the workers of this fine establishment to mine and my youngsters' rendition of Southern, Irish, Australian, etc.  It is a rule, in my family.  You don't get DQ unless you order it with an accent. These DQ employee troopers always play along, even when they think we're making a joke on them.  I assure you, DQ family, we are not joking on YOU, we love you, and we adore that you let us do our weird thing.  THANK YOU!  
P.S. If you want to throw an accent of your own back at us, we'd probably really love it!",5
"I wish I could rate this place 6 stars. The ambience as soon as you walk in had a upscale bar type feel to it. You somewhat get this feeling that you are going to have to sit out with everyone which was quite loud. The waitress took us around back to a secluded booth where my date and I could converse in piece and enjoy the delicous food. Everything was absolutely phenomenal from the get go. Our server Kevin was not only knowledgeable of items on the menu but very personable. My date and I enjoyed the atmosphere and food selection. If im not mistaken the manager came to check on us. This is not the ""Oh hey are you ok...ok good"". You can tell she genuinely cared about how are evening was going. I have literally tried sushi from here to Timbuktu and this is by far the best sushi. We also tried the Saki ""Leechi"" which was delicious. A bit pricey but well worth it. Again, my date and I thoroughly enjoyed our evening at Pisces and will be back very soon!",5
"SO much better than the take out we used to get from another local Chinese restaurant. The cashew chicken has large chunks of fresh veggies (zucchini, snow peas, carrots, mushrooms, celery and water chestnuts), good quality chicken, and they're not stingy with the cashews either. I can also vouch for the Lo Mein, Vegetable Fried rice (again, plentiful with the fresh veggies), and Beef & Broccoli. Reasonably priced, and very large portions. I always order online and they have everything ready for the time I want it ready to pick up. Just click ""menu"", then you can put the various items in your cart.",4
Went for a real breakfast. We went on a Friday morning and were seated right away. I had eggs over easy sausage patties and potatoes. I don't usually clean my plate but I did on Friday. Today I went for lunch once again the food was good. I didn't clean my plate but took my left overs with me. This will be a regular spot for me. The staff is friendly and the service is fast.,5
"Knowledgable and friendly guys that really take their time to get it right. I can't thank them enough for getting my MacBook working again. 
(P.S. - Worth the drive if you live in Scottsdale. The other store was the opposite experience.)",4
"Pizza and food was good but the service was lacking. They don't have the ability to handle large orders the day of.  I don't fault them for having a small kitchen but they should have let me know they couldn't handle two extra large and three large pizzas, wings and a salad. Our order took over two and a half hours to receive and we had to go get it after wanting it delivered.",2
"For a Michael Mina restaurant, I expected a lot more.  I was definitely disappointed because I overpaid for the food.  Atmosphere was great and the service was great too, but it's the food what counts.  I went with my family and we ordered a bunch of things.  They provided us with the trio of duck fat fries, which was the best part of the dinner. There was an aioli sauce that was fantastic.  The fries were not greasy, but so aromatic and melted in your mouth.  We ordered several appetizers.  The lobster mini grill cheese with a side of tomato soup was the best tomato soup.  It was light and slightly sweet.  The sandwich was really greasy and buttery and I couldn't taste a hint of lobster for the life of me.  The foie gras came in a form of two small burgers, which were adorable but I didn't touch it. We had another appetizer that had something to do with crab, but can't remember it much.  Then came our steaks and sides.  Everything was REALLY salty.  It wasn't just me and my palate, everyone mentioned it even before I did.  The bacon creamed spinach was the worst, I think the bacon didn't help the saltiness of it.  I couldn't eat it after one bite.  Which was really disappointing because I always look for creamed spinach as good as Lawrys.  The mac and cheese was also salty.  Since it was truffled mac and cheese, I expected it to melt in my mouth but of course it was salty!  also they used cavatappi pasta, which is hallowed corkscrew pasta that they cut short...not the best for mac and cheese.  Scalloped Potatoes was nothing special and the mushrooms with onions were also really salty.  Thought I would get a nice piece of steak, since it is a steak house but, it was really salty as well.   It was nicely cooked, and perfectly charred and would have been perfect if someone had not dumped a bottle of salt all over my food.  I was just bewildered and thought it must be a mistake or an abberation, but, I don't know, not coming back here again.  The passionfruit panna cotta was really sour...it made your face pucker horribly and the creme brulee was nothing special either.  Very disappointing and expensive.",3
Please note that it seems Flower Child has now (maybe they've always been?) decided to close on Tuesdays.  The last time I wanted to visit Flower Child I tried to go on a Tuesday and had of course forgotten by the time I wanted to go back and look for something else.  I still love them and they're fabulous- maybe all of that being fabulous requires some rest on Tuesdays.,4
"My mom and I went here the other night for her birthday. I have been here multiple times and am somewhat known as a regular.  I love their maki rolls, if you love the basic spicy crab then you must try it here!  I also recommend the spicy scallop.  The spicy mayo is actually spicy here compared to Sakura's sweet spicy mayo and that is the way I prefer it.  I always have a great experience here the servers are excellent and the hostess is awesome.  Yes you are going to wait a awhile to receive your sushi during their happy hour, it's happy hour and very busy!",5
"I joined 4 months ago, before I started working. The pressure was on instantly to sell me into 'expensive' programs, but once I said I wasn't working they backed off. They took my credit card number but promised to only use it for the first month - as I was to pay all others ($29) every month in cash.

4 months later: UPDATE: I started working, have been unable to get there, and they have ben charging my card every month! Not only that - but they raised my rates to $45 a month. This is crap. They told me AFTER I SIGNED that I must go 2 times a month or by charged a $100 fee!!!

Avoid at  all costs, I wish I did. I am going to cancel and will update you on the cost of that - I think they are going to try to screw me for more than $100!!!  So much for the free, no contract BS.",1
This is the best boba place ive ever been to. If im craving for boba this is the first thing that come to my mind.,5
"What not to do while trying to get into a hip happenin (please note major sarcasm there) Scottsdale club after a few too many drinks and a sassy streak running on full steam by stephy s.

Me: ""Ohhhh shit, are we goin' to da cluuuuuhb? Awwwhhh yeeeahhh!!!""

(Walks up to door guy who we'll call Aggroman to protect identities of big headed ego inflated jackasses)

Me: ""Hey, I like your emblem!""

Aggroman: ""What.""

Me: ""Your emblem (reaching out to tap gold emblem on macho man's blazer whilst giggling like the smart ass drunk girl I am)""

Aggroman: ""ID.""

Me: ""Jeez, was just saying I liked your broach, sheeesh.""

Aggroman: (visibly aggro and motioning me in) ""Go.""

Me: (under my breath, which probably was rather loud) Dang, isn't this Scottsdale, what up with the attitude?!!? This ain't LA, shiiiiiiit (clearly I think I'm from the hood now with my gansta speak)

Inside da cluuuuub what do we find? Well sadly, not nearly enough scantily clad sluts. I mean, I go to clubs for one reason and one reason only...sluts, hoochies, hood rat hood rat hoochie mamas and this place was strikin out big time. It did, however offer up a fun variety of cougars and possums, though! This gave me some hope as I was also told earlier in the evening that Scottsdale has, per capita, the highest number of Sugar Daddy's in the nation, so let's face it, I wanted to meet one of those too. Hey, why not, it was Wednesday after all and I was staying at the Valley HO!! :)

After striking out in the Sugar Daddy and slut categories, I decided to entertain myself by taking camera phone pictures of random girls dancing, but apparently people are too cool to pose for fun pics like this. My theory is that Girls Gone Wild killed it for everyone! Thanks a lot Joe Francis!! Whatever. I got a shot of a half nekkid girl dancing anyway, so there. 

Moral of the story. Don't take me out to da cluuuuhhhb. The end. :)",1
This place is amazing! It's a small flower shop in downtown Glendale but it's super cute! They have some pre made arrangements ready or you can order what you need. I went in for a bouquet of tulips for my wedding and they turned out perfect! Robin did an amazing job and even had them done early for me so I just had to pick it up and go!,5
"Yummy Indian food. I guess reading from precious reviews that this place just opened. Anyways, we will be coming back forsure.",5
"My husband and I stayed at the Wynn for a business conference, our daughter and her significant other joined us in Vegas while there. Wanted to treat them to a really nice family dinner. While the Wynn is one of the most
Beautiful places we've stayed- they need to look into staff training in this particular restaurant! The food is fantastic! Can't say enough about the good menu choices and execution- but the service is terrible! Huge downside!  Our server was friendly, but
She was really bad at timing and attention. Ordered drinks and salad first, after a really long wait! We were done with our salads before our drinks ever came! She didn't ever come to check whether we wanted another throughout dinner, which we did. Again- the food is great! And the chefs are doing a great job! But in a resort of this price level we expected better service.  The steaks were very good- but don't expect your water glass to be refilled, or
To  be able to order anything else from the bar!",3
"The food is amazing, fresh and full of flavor. The server was fast, attentive, and friendly. They are family friendly and recommend a soup for our toddler that he just loved. We will definitely come here again.",5
"As a Californian I feel it's unfair for me to review El Toro, which may be just fine for Champaign but would be utterly crushed if it were located anywhere near San Francisco.  The food wasn't very authentic and I'm not even sure this was as good as a Chevy's.

THE ICKY:
- The salsa was barely better than salsa you get out of a jar from the supermarket.  Where are the tomatoes?  The chips taste similarly store-bought.
- The guacamole had no personality... maybe they couldn't get fresh avocados?
- The cheese inside the quasadilla tasted really off.  Were they using American cheese or something?
- The tacos from head-to-toe were just not great, from the shell to the meat.

THE GOOD:
- I did like the horchata.  :)
- Despite the ickiness, I left pretty full, so large portion sizes with reasonable prices.
- It had the ambiance of a taqueria, but was cleaner.
- Service was fast and efficient.",2
"The first few times I was there, it was pretty good. Today, it was disgusting.  I had a Zinger salad and it was awful.  Dried up greens, some pieces of chopped up tomatoes and the Zingers were dry too. I have NO desire to go back. I got the feeling that now that they have been there for a while, they dont need to make the effort anymore.  There are way too many places to go. No one should have to tolerate a less than acceptable meal.",1
"Please note that I am writing this review for a foodcourt restaurant and that is why I am awarding it five stars. It's not fine cuisine. However, for a fast food type of restaurant, it is absolutely delicious. The ingredients are fresh. The recipes are tasty. There is a lot of variety.  The kitchen is very clean. And they have some dim sum!!!! Amazing! I never thought a food court meal could be so satisfying And delicious. Enjoy!!!!",5
"The staff at Sun Devil Trophy went above and beyond for our annual family charity golf tournament, 6-18. Shipments from their vendors were both wrong AND late! However, they made it happen, kept me informed and all is well. The behind the scenes work is what counts and they delivered. Have used them for years and with the same results---always right! They are the best for any and all ""trophy merchandise"" and engraving.

"A group of friends went to RuRus last week. From the minute I walked in until the minute I left, it was BAD!! The hostess acted like she didn't have time for me (staring out the window). She finally walked away and someone else asked if I needed help.
Next our waiter, was gone more than present. The restaurant was busy on the patio, but empty inside. Every course of our food took a VERY LONG time. So long we had to search for him to get... water refills, more drinks and our food. I can't even think about recommending this place. Oh yeah the food wasn't anything that could make up for the terrible service.",1
"every time someone recommends the place, I cringe, unfortunately in the area, it's about the easiest place to dine, that being said their pizza (the only thing on the menu) is terrible, i truly prefer the crap thy used to serve us in middle school.

My tip, drink a lot before going so that you don't care about the state of the food",2
"I work nearby and wanted to get a Friday morning treat so I tried Jimmy's coffee. IIt's a small shop that looks cute from the outside. It has a decent amount of seating inside and some outside. There was a line of about 5 people since it was 9am, but someone took my order while I was in line, so that made it go by faster! The girl who took my order was super sweet and friendly. 

I got:

Large Dirty Iced Chocolate Chai (Chocolate Chai Latte with a shot of espresso)

It was delicious! A little too sweet for an everyday thing, but next time I would get two shots of espresso for the large size to cut back on the sweetness. 

The bakery items look really good. I will be back here to meet friends for coffee or have a coffee break with colleagues.",5
"Brown sugar pancakes... Heavenly!!!! I had them fresh so it was nice and toasty and warm. I also tried all three walnut cakes.  They are nice, but I preferred the pancakes more. Maybe because these were not warm when I got them. Super inexpensive. And the line moves fast.  There's also seating on the inside. Will come back to try the other desserts.",4
Love this place. The office cats just roam freely. They took excellent care of our cats.,5
"Update! For this who like milkier/richer milk teas, definitely try the half and half option! Before I tried this I thought that it might give the milk tea a strange taste, since half and half is so distinct. However, it blended in quite well and didn't have any strange taste/aftertaste at all! This will probably be my go-to option for milk teas here from now on. 

As for fruit-flavored tea (without milk), I found them to use quite a bit of syrup for the small size. I got a Passionfruit Green Tea with Lychee Jelly. The passionfruit flavor was pretty strong, and made it quite sweet even though I got 'light sweetness'. My friend got a large Lychee Black Tea and the syrup taste was not as strong in his. I'm thinking this is probably because he got a large and it was more evenly distributed? The lychee jelly was on point though! Pretty sure most places get the same lychee jelly anyways.",4
"The place came highly recommended by a friend. I won't be listening to them anymore. Ordered the dry aged ribeye , my choice, but highly touted by the waiter. I ordered it rare, but he said that would would make the meat too chewy??? I asked that it be on the rare side of medium rare. Steak arrived well done, so I asked for the next to be rare, and I would take my chances. This one came out medium well. It was supposed to be 18 oz bone in. It was a half inch thick, and couldn't have weighed 12 oz. I haven't been to the Sizzler since I was 12, but I would give the edge to the Sizzler. They offered to redo a third time, but my wife was already done. They took my steak off the bill, and I still had to pay $175 for apps my wife, 2 sides, and 2 drinks. When I asked the manager to rethink the bill, he said that was the best he could do. With all the good choices in Vegas, this should be your last choice.  P.S. I eat out 7 nights a week, and you'll see I only have 5 other reviews. I only take the time to do this if the place deserves it.",1
Damn tasty Laotian food. Wish I would have known about this place when I lived here. I wouldn't have been such a wuss about spicy Asian food when I moved out to San Francisco. The food seems very authentic and the portions are actually perfect. Crunchy veggies and tasty curries. And where else in the world can you get a Spotted Cow or Two Hearted Ale with a Laotian meal?,5
"Hello all, 

  Just want to let you know that if you need a fair, honest and careful moving company, Budget is the company. They moved my house full of furniture from Ahwatukee to Mesa without one scratch on any of it and were $500 below the big boys to boot!
  Jim, the owner was great as were his people. We did not even have him sign the contract, which could have been a problem. But when we overpaid him, he called the next day and told us we had a $200 refund coming because the move took less time than anticipated. Sure enough, a check arrived in the mail. What more can you ask for. 
Best regards to all.

"I was really skeptical of this place at first, thinking it was going to be hipster vomit and mega-over priced drinks. But after spending some time there on their non-busy nights, I really enjoy the place. The bartenders are always super friendly and chatty. The drink menu is very unique and fun. $12-$14 for their signature cocktails, but they are worth it. The decor is bad ass. Very unique. I always feel like I am sitting in one of my rich friends' dad's basement. Except instead of stealing from his bar, I just pay for my drinks like an adult ;)",5
"This place was not what I expected at all after reading all the amazing reviews. I had couple of friends in town who wanted to do Italian on the strip. I yelped a place and this came up and seemed perfect. First, it took us forever to find the place A pretty well hidden. Then, the place was in reality small, lots of light, and there wasn't anything special about it. We didn't really care - we were there for a good Italian meal and to catch up. 
Five stars for service - the service was actually good and everyone was nice and courteous at all times. Five stars For the tiramisu as well. Even though I am not a tiramisu person at all but that was the table's choice I loved it. It comes in a glass and the tiramisu part is really only on the bottom - there's something like a vanilla pudding/creme brûlée filling that was very tasty. 
However, the food was ok. Just ok. Absolutely nothing special. We got couple of pizzas that were ok and my husband got the ny strip special ($60 meal) and described it as ""the worse steak"" he recently ate. For that kind of money you can get a real steak at a good steakhouse and go home happy. I did not completely hate the place but I will definitely not return.",3
"In general this is a petty good Walmart, as long as you don't have to deal with management. Once management gets involved everything turns to crap In the insanity of shopping for all the Thanksgiving stuff I asked a Grocery Management employee if they carried Portuguese sausage, otherwise known as Lunguicia. She had no idea what I was talking about, but if I provided her w/ a UPC code of the product she could check. 
Told her I didn't know what the UPC might be as I don't carry them around in my head or back pocket. Told her I thought she might be able to look such information up....She got a bit trite (irritated) told me I didn't need to tell her how to do here job. Told her I'd check with another grocer who could assist me. She shrugged her shoulders, waived said ""That's your choice"", and went about her assigned task unloading frozen turkeys. Great customer service....Management has no clue how to keep a customer.",1
"My fiance loves this place to death. I have tried about 10 dishes here in hopes of finding one that I will like enough to be happy when he wants to order Fugu instead of switching into clever-ploys-to-do-something-other-than-Fugu mode.

I can't put my finger on it, exactly, but everything seems to be too much or too little of too many things. Too spicy, too greasy, too bland, too many bones I have to pick out. It's like that dish that you cook for yourself at home and when you go to taste it you think oh dang, this isn't very good but I made it so I might as well eat it. But you don't really want to feel that way about takeout that you get all the time, you know?",2
One of my pubs in the city.  I read somewhere that this is one of the local spots where Rolling Stones drink when they're in town.  The crowd here is a little more mature but i think that rings true of most pub environments.,5
"I loved the Hofbrauhaus great beer, great food, and great service. The Hofbrauhaus is a must stop if visiting Cleveland.",5
"I was celebrating something that I had been working on for a while and wanted to come down to somewhere special in Toronto!

Harbour 60 exceeded its reputation for steaks! I was pleasantly surprised to see the 10 oz. Waygu steak on the menu and had to get it. Aside from the price, it is one of the best steak's I've had in a while! It resembles a ""pork belly"" in texture more than anything!!

I was there for a short time, since I had to catch a flight back but the staff was courteous and the food was delicious!",5
"Waited a few minutes at the counter until an employee slowly walked up and asked for our order. We get the half chicken salad and smoothie to go. When we got home the sandwich was missing tomato, and had the tiniest amount of chicken salad! Guess that's what happens when there's no management and the store is run by teenagers... Will post photos",1
"Not bad for a chain. I think with Il Piazzaiolo and Mercurio's there's really no competition, but for a quick bite in Settlers Ridge, it was a-okay!

I ordered the roasted cauliflower pizza. The cauli was roasted to a crisp and I really liked the Parmesan cheese on top. An individual size pizza was plenty for a lunch portion too.

I also ordered a Bloody Mary since it was on special (I can't help myself). It wasn't horrible, but kinda boring. 

The service was incredibly friendly. I just wish they weren't blasting the AC, as I was felt like I needed a parka to eat inside in August. I'll take my pizza parka free, thanks!",3
Is this the same Sunny's that use to own the corner store on Lake Mead and Englestad? If so I'm gonna hit it up this weekend. I remember the chicken tasting soooo good to be sooo cheap!!!,5
"Wow!!!!!
Awesome ice cream maybe the best I have ever had..fantastic service , very clean inside and good vibe",5
"I have never had such bad service in my life!  Came in to find the hostess on the phone for about 10 minutes before even greeting me.  Finally, I was seated hoping my experience here would get better.  Then the waitress was horrible!  What are the chances.  She didn't make eye contact, wasn't friendly....can't say anything good about her.  The food was okay, but after the terrible service, the food didn't matter.  I couldn't wait to get out of there!  That waitress needs to find another job where she has no contact with the public.",1
"It is extremely difficult not to give Wong's Asian Cuisine 4 stars, and here are the reasons​:

1) Portion - gigantic is the right description.  We ordered a Manchurian Beef Noodle ($8) for take out.  It filled 2 boxes.  My BF and I could only finish 1 of the 2 boxes together.

2) Price - Very affordable.  $8 for a Manchurian Beef/Chicken Noodle.  $9 for a Chicken Pakora.  There were about 15 pieces of pakora (see picture).  Each piece was the size of a golf ball.  Lunch special is $6 per item, available Monday to Friday.

3) Services - The waitress was fast, effective and friendly.  She gave us extra napkins per request.  Like 4 extra thick napkins.  It was pretty generous.  

4) Cleanliness - the exterior of the store looked divey.  The interior looked nothing special.  The washroom (ladies) was, surprise surprise, very clean and tidy.  Yes, the bathroom amenities were no frills and basic, but it was CLEAN as in no dust, no spot or mark, no mess on floor.  I won't say completely dust free, but it beat the cleanliness level of many expensive restaurants.  And there was hot water, hand soap, paper towels.  I was impressed.  Someone cared about washroom here.

5) Food - I am no authority of Indian Chinese food.  Did the food taste the way it was supposed to taste like?  No clue.  I could tell you everything tasted bold. There were strong spices flavours.  The pakoras were delicious.  The noodle was average: mostly noodle, little beef, orange in colour.  The noodle was noted as non-spicy on menu.  It was actually mildly spicy.  Food was made to order.  It came out of kitchen piping hot.  

The food rating is 3 stars in truth.  I round it up to 4 stars, because the first 4 aspects are not just good, but extremely strong.",4
"Had just arrived in town and came in on a whim to grab dinner.  Sat at the bar and waited patiently for 15 minutes without being acknowledged or otherwise looked at... The 'host' even took a menu off another table once they were done ordering, and put it away 5 ft away from me, instead of handing it to me.  Would not recommend",1
"They are good folks, everyone I worked with was very nice and personable. My experience was quite excellent, I am just a little upset on the out the door price.  We came to an agreement on the final price of the car.  The change in price should have reflected on the Out the Door price, when in fact it did not change at all.  I know this old trick, they would do this at the dealership I worked at when I was 16, but it was 7 PM on a Saturday Night and I just wanted to go home.  I was irritated that they got one over on me.  I ended up paying the same price he had quoted me out the door an hour earlier, even after I said no way and tried to leave and we negotiated a much lower final price on the car.  They basically took what I saved on the final price and added it to the fee's/documentation.  Hahaha.  I know better than this, so it was my own carelessness (they just wore me down).  The used car I purchased was still not a terrible deal, and it is a beautiful facility with excellent customer service.  I didn't have the heart to give them 3 stars...  Go in understanding your final out the door price after tax, title and license, do not budge, check the final numbers on your paperwork before signing.  Their Financing come in with a decent number as well, but get a pre-approval through another institution so you know your range.  Overall, good experience, but they are excellent SALES People.  So, expect to pay a little more for picking a vehicle and driving it off the lot.",4
AMAZING!!!  We drive all the way from Summerlin.  A good 30 minute drive!!!! Everything is delicious.  Please build a cafe in Summerlin!!,5
"It's not every day that I take pleasure in being able to eat my own words.

A week before my visit, I got to talk to the chef about a really mean story that I overheard about him 2x from someone that I trust. We got it all sorted out, and he even sent me a picture of him...

HOLDING A BABY GOAT.

Whaaaat. Service here was fucking amazing, Megan is a boss and super-friendly. It's not every restaurant that I can go to in town that is not only vegan-friendly, not only goes out of their way to assure you that they're vegan-friendly, but even makes their own silken tofu and makes me a tofu charcuterie board. And vegan versions of their appetizers so that I don't feel left out! I teared up.

Then they made a dessert that wasn't just plain cut-up fruit! A week later, and the picture I posted on IG is still getting likes from all over the world. It tasted every bit as good as it looked. It was almost too pretty to eat.

So thanks, Chef Darren and the crew at Downtown Food! You guys are my new favorite.",5

"What an amazing experience with Mastro's! 
We came in with a large party for a Christmas dinner. This was most of my guests first time dining here. We had a view of the treehouse, love the architecture! There was no wait for a table. 
We started with Calamari, Smoked Salmon Caesar Salad and Chopped Salad. The bread basket was to die for! We enjoyed New York strip, Filet, Chicken, Artic Char, and my favorite the Sea Bass! We had so many sides, they were all wonderful! 
Our servers Trista and Daniel were wonderful. Very friendly, always made sure we had a drink and were happy. And the manager Luciana checked on us a few times making sure we were enjoying each course. 
Best dinner in Vegas ever! Can't wait to return!",5
"Their shrimp tacos are amazing. Also Mexican pizza! We haven't found anything we didn't like. Very busy on weekends, but Monday night's are perfect.",5
So good! bought a dozen minis! These are so light and creamy. I could have 1 a day and die a very happy woman. Everyone should try them.,5
"These guys are litteraly The BEST Auto Glass company in Vegas. Their customer service is so excellent it was refreshing to work with them. I am so happy with them, all my friends and family are going to be referred to them. Between their top notch customer service and their amazing work i could not be happier. Customer service in this town is something that a lot of businesses seriously lack in and they have it down perfectly. I can't speak highly enough about them words cannot describe how happy I am with them.

Thank you so much for replacing my windshield!",5
We had a 2 for one coupon and we had brunch. Great service and food  French toast with cream cheese and orange marbelade stuff. Oh so good !,4
"Tankfully for the big SULIKO Sign off of Steeles this place was an easy-find.
Known for its traditional Georgian (with some Russian hints in between) Suliko is nestled in a cozy environment with both indoor and outdoor seating.
Great family restaurant and the servers are attentive to detail.
Daily specials, and don't miss out on their BBQ.

For starters we had their Khinkali - pork and beef dumplings 

Hachapuri Adjarsky - a traditional Georgian boat-shaped bread with melted cheese topped off with a half-cooked egg...mmm if you love cheese, you'll like this place.

Chanahi - we both shared their traditional Georgian lamb stew.  Though this may seem small, this dish is a lot.  Delicious broth with hearty flavors, this was certainly comfort food.",4
This place is fantastic!!!! The drinks are earthy! But the food is hands down amazing!!! Can't wait to go back!,5

My husband and I tried this place again. This time we had a better experience. I had the grilled romaine salad with basil vinaigrette. It was a delicious salad! My husband had a brisket sandwich and chips. He really liked it. The flavors were good and the food was fresh.  We will be back!,4
Best nail salon in town ! The perfect place for a luxury pedicure honestly feel like I'm at a day spa :) great prices and quality. Will return for sure,5
"I was invited back to the restaurant by the owner to give it another try. 

Alexandria our server was awesome. She gets 5 stars just for being so lovely.

I tried the A2, Frying Tuna, and Screaming O... They were good, all offering something a little different.

The BEST was the Tempura Oreos. Sounds bonkers, right? No! Eat them.. Be willing to get too full off of them... They are heaven.",4
"Have only ever come here for the Dim Sum which is awesome. Staff isn't SUPER friendly as has been mentioned but the service has always been great, and I actually did once get a cart lady who was just hilarious and awesome and introduced me to my new favorite dumpling. Saturday around noon seems a lot less busy than Sunday. Looking forward to going back soon with more people simply so I cab order more food.",5

"Holy crap this place is unbelievable. I don't really know how to avoid repeating cliches about the shock of eating sushi this good in the middle of the Sonoran desert. But that sums it up. Yasu is some freakazoid eccentric genius of a Japanese chef who for whatever reason decided to set up shop in a nondescript area of Phoenix, Arizona. I don't know how to explain it, and I've concluded that there are no answers so as long as he's here I may as well enjoy it.",5
I went there for the first time yesterday to try out a couple guns that I wanted to try since I was in the market for my first handgun. The RO was really nice and informative and taught me how to shoot the proper way. I then decided I also needed to try an MP5 which was probably the best decision I made because it was super fun! I plan on definitely going back and getting a membership. thanks again guys!,5
"I was hesitant to write a review because I felt sheepish saying that we heartily enjoyed the food but still would never likely return. The reason was that Graft's service was so over-attentive and cloying that we barely got a moment to ourselves on what was intended to be a relaxing, romantic night together. Every dish required an elaborate speech about every minuscule ingredient. The details are there on the menu, so why does each meal's composition require a second recitation? One of two servers - or the manager - stopped by about twice for every course or drink we ordered. At one point we were admittedly canoodling in our booth and the server came by to ask if we were enjoying our meal. Not any more! For Pete's sake, just walk away and let the customers enjoy their meals! I've experienced this same misstep elsewhere in Madison, but never to such a farcical extent. It was really unprofessional. Why can't we emulate Paris, one of the culinary capitals of the world, where servers bring you the food, return when summoned, and otherwise respect your privacy? 
Another misstep was seating us directly next to a family of small children when the restaurant was otherwise empty. As a former restaurant hostess, I'm aware that that is THE LAST PLACE a young couple wants to be on a romantic night out. 

In any event, there's my two cents. I wanted to like Graft (and still do!) because the decor is absolutely beautiful (puts Estrellón to shame) and the food is tasty on the whole. The pheasant and flank steak were both great. The doughnuts and ice cream for dessert were fantastic. (Drinks and wine selection? Absurdly pricey and off-base for Madison. Show me a decent glass of red for $6.) But I can't ever eat there again if I'm committing to share the experience with half the staff.",3
"Yup, it's the crazy-genius fries & ice cream combo place.

The parmesan-truffle fries were great.  Other places offer fries with truffle oil & parmesan cheese, but I think these are the best I've had.  The fries themselves are really good, plenty of fluffy, freshly grated parm, and really aromatic truffle oil.

The ice cream?  It's excellent.  Great mouthfeel, powerful flavors, and really well-executed.  Turkish coffee was literally like a creamy frozen cup of turkish coffee (grounds included).  Mmmmm.",4
Love the ambiance of this place . Ordered the crunch roll and the sashimi cocktail! Sooooo goood !!!,4
"If you're looking for something a more relaxing and less crazy than EBC, then this pool is for you. 3 other guys and I got in for free, and when I came in, I could understand why it was free. It wasn't as packed as other dayclubs, and it was a lot more mellow. The DJ was playing pretty good music, and the drinks were pretty strong.

The pool itself is pretty small, fitting about 40-50 people max. There were plenty of seating areas and cabanas, but a lot of them were empty at the time. Overall, its a pretty good place to go for free. Would I pay to check this place out? Probably not.",3
Best Pizza in Charlotte.  PLAIN AND SIMPLE!  They Do it right. Great owner and operator.,5
"I bought See's lollipops for years over the internet and finally when I moved to Pittsburgh I actually found a See's store.
The store has an excellent variety of all the see's products.
I bought a couple of lollipops and a few pieces of dark chocolate.
The Lollipops are the best anywhere and they have many flavors too choose from.
I am partial to the chocolate lollipop myself.
The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful.
I love See's and do highly recommend them for your many and gift needs.
I will definitely be going again.",4
"Requested an early morning appointment in hopes that I wouldn't have to wait long with two small children in tow. Unfortunately I was given a later morning appointment and subsequently had to wait an hour in the waiting room. Once back in the exam room, we were done within minutes.

"Nothing outstanding but a good value for the price. Most items were good, a few not as hot as you might like. Service was timely and friendly.",3
"My family comes here fairly often for dim sum and the quality of the food is consistent and generally good. Go in the morning (around 9) to avoid the lineups and the parking situation, and to get the special prices. Service is as expected from a Chinese restaurant - quick and to the point.

After 12 you can get the lunch dishes which are quite good as well! We are a fan of the thick noodles (ho fun) in satay/black bean sauce. Dinner is also decently priced and good quality, though we haven't been in a while. Overall, this place is a solid choice for any meal of the day.",3
I have been ordering from here for quite awhile but over the last couple of months the food has been horrible. Shrimp fried rice I received today had no taste and spring rolls were under cooked. I will not order from them again.,1
We live near by and have been waiting for a Thai restaurant to open up close by. We went on a saterday at lunch and it was very busy. The food was very good and they had a very good menu to order from. The service was slow but the staff was very friendly.,5
So I was so excited to eat here..i celebrated my 50th bday last fri..and was asked where I'd like to go eat..i chose metro diner..walked in .. wasn't that busy..we stood up front no1 up there..so we didn't know if we're suppose to seat ourselves or wait to be seated..finally a server came over and sat us..she was running around .. finally got our drinks..she was friendly enough..then a nice man came over and spoke to us..i assume he was the gm..we ordered the fried chicken dinner..i got fries with mine. and a side salad..a huge plus the ranch was homemade..we waited a long time for our food..server came over and apologized that chicken was taking longer then expected..we ok..no big deal..at least we know it's fresh..we got our food..1st off my sister had mashed..i can't believe they serve brown gravy with fried chx dinner..my fries you can tell had been double fried..no season..just bland..so we bit into the chx and it's raw..pink all over inside..i asked to see manager..he finally came ..i think he had to have been the assist.. manager..we told him ..he was so rude and was trying to argue with us..and looked at the chx and acted like nothing was wrong when u could clearly see are chx was raw ..he said the fries were fresh..i work at a high volume rest..in a casino..so I knew they were not..he was very abrupt with us..he has no business dealing with guest..he was also back thr cooking..my managers would never nor would I speak to a guest the way he did..i can deal with the raw chicken and just order something else..however i can not tolerate a rude employee..we were very nice...i asked for the gm..he was training..so I flagged a gentlemen over who was the gm at a different location..he was great..he knew hiw to handle a guest recovery situation..he offered us a whole meal on the house..i declined..he gave me two 13 dlr..coupons.. I honestly want to call corporate about the assist managers behavior..needless to say i don't ever want to patronize that location again..not because if the food..because the way we were treated...,1
"Awesome hotel for the family! Very clean, lots of space and lots of staff keeping it secure. I've been to most of the major hotels around the strip and this one is by far the best. Because there's no casino in the lobby, the hotel feels very clean, upscale and smog free. 
If you're looking for a place to stay with the family, then this is the place!",5
"Really love this Barro's! The staff is always very friendly and efficient, the pizza is always great... they are never stingy with the cheese or toppings. Plus the location is right next to my neighborhood, so it makes it super easy to stop by on our way home.",5
"It's expensive. And not super air-conditioned. And half of the (very tiny) audience seemed drunk, at 1:00pm, on a Saturday. But it's right on the Strip. And that's about all I can say.",3
I had the pulled pork sandwich with Memphis BBQ sauce. It was great!,4
"Open 24 hrs! Sweet! Love picking up the ready to eat dishes here and other random things. They also have household wares and gadgets. The produce are always fresh though they may not always have what I want. The prices are slightly higher than at T&T. 

The only bad thing about this place is the parking. Space is a little bit tight. As with all asian supermarket parking, my suggestion is to be alert at all times & back in or you will never be able to leave :)",4
"I went there not to long ago & I was greeted by a very nice girl, lupe! It is amazingggg! She prepared my smoothie, which was bomb! (: deffinatley go!",5
"The only mall we really go to. It is very nice, not necessarily what I would call ""upscale."" I mean, it is far from Mill....

Great selection of stores, and the center kiosk employees do not pester you, however the asian massage place will beg you to come into their dark creepy doors. Please just stay behind your counter, your 20 seconds (trial) slap down will not convince me.

Other than that, it is a mall! It is surrounded by great/no so great  restaurants of all different varieties.  

I avoid this movie theater due to all the kids and young folk. There are nicer Harkins within minutes of this one.",4
"Good food but bad customer service. Went on Jan 1st after reading good reviews here. Called ahead of time to make sure they'd be open as I was bringing a group and they even took my reservation. Got there and found the place closed! Not cool. Waited a bit as there were others waiting in the parking lot too, and they finally opened, half hour after my reservation! But once we were in the buffet lunch was pretty good. I stuck with the vegetarian, which was excellent. Others members of my group who had the non veg were disappointed; the tandoori looked like it was from the night before and the masala chicken had about 3 pieces in a vat of curry sauce (literally, I saw it for myself!). Also, there wasnt enough staff; it took forever to get out naan, chai, coffee. But once the place opened, it quickly filled up with what seemed like repeat customers...so  at least they seem to have a good enough track record to to keep people coming back!",3
"Mel is a wonderful artist. She tries to find out what you're looking for and then she makes suggestions that will make you feel and look better than you imagined! She is hilarious, talented and has a heart of gold. I am grateful to know her and so is my hair...(she now calls herself my ""hair doctor""). You will not be disappointed!",5
"One of the things Publix prides itself on are their employees. Today I experienced one of the most rude employees I've ever experienced at a Publix store. My wife called snd spoke with the manager, who didn't seem to care.I won't be back.",1
Spending Father's Day lunch with the gals at Woonam was fun fun fun! Certainly LOTS to eat but what made it so pleasurable  was that the gals really made sure we were eating the bbq the right way... grilling the kimchi. .adding it to the beef with the thinnest pickled radish.. eating it like a Korean taco. With the pork belly... the fat of the belly tamed the spicyness of the kimchi or pickled papaya. Pure delight!,4
"This is an amazing breakfast or brunch restaurant. I personally like the breakfast better than their lunch or steak etc. Last time I was there, I tried the sausage patties which were included in my meal (Homestead Meal), they were not as good as the breakfast. Wow, the eggs were delicious (I ordered sunny side up), and with the eggs, you can order some kind of bread. I suggest the white toast, but if you don't like butter, you wouldn't like it because t is covered in butter. I also recommend the hot chocolate. When I went here in Sandusky, there weren't many people there and it still took them a long time to serve my food, but our server was super nice and kid friendly and I think it's so funny that all of the Bob Evans restaurants look exactly the same! Overall, I like the restaurant's breakfast and drinks better.",4
"The place was great when it first opened and a few times after that. WHAT happened? Quality of the food definitely went down and so did the service. The Kalbi was all gristle and talk about skimping on the Panchan (small side dishes), which came out late. They usually bring those out right away. We saw tables that got theirs even though they came in quite some time after we did. We came between 7:00p till about 8:30pm and the service was SLOW. The part that really got under our skin was the unbelievably RUDE and un-attentive waitresses we had that were waiting on us. Definitely not the norm for Korean restaurants. They never smiled. Had no patience. And when my mother asked one of the waitresses a simple question about the side dishes the table next to us was getting (as they had the side dishes we used to get the first few times we came to the restaurant--A LOT more and varietal), she literally gave my mom a dirty look and blurted out an answer that neither of us could understand. My mom looked at me and I had no idea what she had said so, my mother asked again. I don't know if the woman was speaking Korean because it sure didn't sound like it to us and that's my mother's native language. Regardless, she was annoyed because we kept on asking her what she was saying. The woman literally walked away. It was time for the check. It's sad because we really liked this place and always had a good experience before. Granted, we used to come during the day but, it still doesn't give them the excuse to have terrible staff in the evenings not to mention, lower the quality of their food. That was definitely disappointing to say the least. The bathroom had a bad leak of some sort in one of the stalls, there was a pool of water in the stalls. I mentioned it to one of the staff members because someone could slip and fall. The woman didn't even stop to listen to me.",1
"Food is very tasty & the service is always amazing! Ask for Christian or Latoya , love them",5
"I had my hair done by Brandi (owner and stylist) and it was awesome! I brought in pictures and my hair was really a mess and she did a fabulous job!  First of all, she does a great massage while washing your hair.  It was awesome!!! I was SO relaxed. Then I had a hair treatment to help my poor over- processed hair and afterwards, it was so soft and shiny I just loved it! 
I changed my hair style very dramatically, by taking off length and adding bangs and a week later, I am still getting tons of compliments! I highly recommend Brandi and her lovely salon.",5
"This charming place is a perfect spot to sit outside and enjoy a beautiful Saturday morning and a great meal.  Going inside we were greeted by the friendly staff and instantly felt welcomed.  We shared the turkey pesto sandwich and potato salad which were both delicious!  The friendly woman who had taken our order brought out yummy potato chips for my son, a nice gesture as we hadn't ordered or paid for them.  The desserts and breakfast casseroles looked tasty, can't wait to go back!",5
Do not come here these people don't care about your business anyway. I had to go back 3 times & my phone still isn't right. They do not treat their customers right especially after they mess up. This was the biggest inconvenience I've ever had to deal with with my phone. Now I'm going to pay someone else to fix it right since these guys don't know what they are doing.,1
"I wasn't impressed. They had a limited menu, especially for vegetarians. The food was ok. The atmosphere is cute and the drinks were pretty good. We haven't been back since.",3
Disappointing. Soggy halibut that didn't taste fresh and had a rubbery texture. Fries were good. Tartar sauce was decent. Coleslaw was ok nothing to write home about. Two stars only because of the fish and price. You can get better fish and chips in town for less.,2
"I've been here a few times and my fave dishes are: pork belly burger/bahn mi sandwich. I also love their fried chicken skins but unfortunately they recently took it out the menu. Everyone always seems nice and they have a pretty good selection of brewed beer. I only took 1 star off because for the price ($15-$17) of their main dishes, it doesn't come w/ any side of anything, not even a small portion of fries.",4
Duck wings are a must and the pork chops & crab cakes were great and our server James made it even better,5
"We just started our three year old here and so far have had a great experience. After talking with the staff, they agreed it would be okay to try the class with 4-6 year olds, as it's at a time that works best for us. However, they recommended she drop into the weekend class for 2-3 year olds for a few weeks at no charge to get used to the equipment and routine without the faster pace and pressure of the older class. With the younger class, a parent can join in with the group. There's plenty of activity, from warm-up to cooldown, obstacle course, bars and rings, trampolines, and more. The class is also a full hour, so you feel like you really get a lot done in that time. The staff is great and clearly used to working with kids, and both Ms. Carol and Mr. Gene are very active in the business. My daughter is excited to go again!",5
The service was absolutely fantastic and each dish was very unique although we didn't enjoy our drinks very much.  Very intimate atmosphere.  Great place for a date.,4
"This place is fantastic....another reviewer called it ""sexy""...spot on.  Cool vibe, great food, great place to go later at night if you want somewhere that's still busy.  Definitely get a reservation.",5
"Malee's Thai Bistro is a Thai restaurant in Scottsdale.  Good not great in this Yelper's opinion, but you'll find some quality dishes in a contemporary atmosphere.

My Overall Rating - 3 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)

Atmosphere - Malee's Thai Bistro has two dining areas.  You'll find a main room and another that accompanies the bar.  On our weekday visit, it was busy, full of energy, and had a nice vibe.  We sat in the room with the bar and it had a nice mural of Southeast Asia on the wall.  1 Star.

Service - Our server was very friendly and helpful.  We did have a problem with one of our dishes (see below) and while she wasn't available during the meal for us to address it, she did have it removed from the bill.  Kudos for that but I would have liked a check in so we could have addressed it earlier.   1/2 Star.

Food - Crispy Basil Chicken - order it.  It's the best item.  You'll get tender, well-seasoned chicken that you can pair with rice or any other noodle dish.  It's slightly sweet with a hint of basil.  We also enjoyed the calamari salad, although it really didn't seem like a Thai dish.  I guess it felt like it was a more American dish vs. Thai, but I was good.  Our Pad Thai was ok - nothing great but nothing bad.  Our one item that was really off was the Pad Woon Sen.  I love this dish - as it has thin glass mung bean noodles, scallions, and egg (main ingredients).  Our dish, however, had a hint of kerosene smell.  As we ate it, something didn't seem right.  We tried to flag down our server but she didn't come back until we were finishing up.  Now, they did remove it from the bill, but it would have been nice to of had the option to replace it instead. 1 Star.

Will I Return? - Maybe.  Aside from the Pad Woon Sen, our meal was good.  Now, I think the menu has a lot of American influences, but there seems to be enough to warrant a return.   1/2 Star.

My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):
1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.
1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.
2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.
1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. 

Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.",3
"What a great place.  If you like interesting foods (Indian, Thai, Middle Eastern), you will love this place. My first experience with Cafe Lalibela was take home from Whole Foods.  It was delicious. I figured I had to go to the source to try the food. It was awesome.  I love the Teff Injera bread.  Their meat dishes are awesome and the portions are quite healthy for the price. If you are in Tempe, you need to go to Cafe Lalibela.",5
I've been coming here for several months now. Everyone is so friendly. If you check in using Yelp you get 20% off your first service and then every time you check in after you get 10% off. My gel nails last 2 weeks (I'm very rough on my nails). I use their online booking system to book my appointments.,5
"Best bbq pork and char siu, especially the sauce!  They're not very friendly but they are fast and tastes good!",4
"Love the Loco Moco & Ramen!
And I really like that I can make reservation online and do not need to line up!

The staffs there do not say much, but they are polite.",4
"Apparently First Watch took over this Good Egg location. The new renovation looks great, although a lot of the seating was removed. We were first disappointed to see that the entire staff had also changed, although the service was just as good so no complaints there, however the food was less than stellar. I was happy to see they had kept several Good Egg specialties along with the best of First Watch, but when the food arrived, it was all pretty tasteless. I ordered spicy breakfast enchiladas. They were covered in what looked and tasted  turkey gravy with virtually no seasoning at all. My husband ordered a basic breakfast with ham. The ham was dry, the rest also tasteless. 
While at first I wondered if removing some of the seating was a bad idea considering how busy I have seen this place get, after eating I can't imagine finding a table will be a problem. Can't say we will be back anytime soon.",2
Took my wife there for dinner and ordered the prix fixe menu. The food was Excellent! price is on the higher side but its to be expected since it's a fine dinning joint. Small portions but cooked to perfection. I was able to save up on my dinning using a restuarant.com gift certificate,5
"Rx pick-up service, w/ Easy Pay (a credit card already on file), in the drive-thru pharmacy lane was efficient on my recent visit. I'm glad this location has a drive-thru for quick needs like this because despite a Rite Aid across the street this is the busiest drug store and there is often times a wait for a parking spot.",4
"I just had a carne asada burrito enchilada style and OMG it was amazing!  I don't know exactly what was in it - but I think it was cilantro that gave it a great flavor, and the rice and beans were in just the right proportion.  I added some tapatio, to spice it up, and yummy!!",5
Great space for an event upstairs. We had over 100 people and Aline did an amazing job hosting a classy event. The food was really good and always hot. The bartenders were well staffed and on point. This was a great venue for a sophisticated event that held a large group.,5
"This place is amazing, right when you walk in the atmosphere instantly sets the mood, their sushi is to die for btw. My boyfriend and I split a monster roll and got the Obon ramen and it was some of the best I've had in the valley. 10/10 would def recommend.",5
"They do an amazing grooming job on my bichon/poodle mix dog, and in a timely manner. They don't accept credit cards and only accept cash, which is understandable for being a small business. They aren't as friendly as I would like and customer service isn't out of this world (it's not bad, just not great), but I think it's just because they may be understaffed and overworked. The grooming they do on my Zoe makes up for it!",4
Hostess told us the high tops in the bar were open seating. So we went in and sat down at a filthy table--but figured they just hadn't had a chance to clean it yet. 10 minutes later some server walks up and says you guys just sit down? We say yes and he says well these tables are not open seating and we need to clean it up. We tell him the hostess said it was open and he says well there not. 10 minutes with no acknowledgement and then a rude welcome. See ya.,1
"Joined bc my friend Tisha is an instructor here. Completed my first 30 day challenge with nooo problem, still very excited. Their instructors are the best I've EVER been with, all insanely knowledgable and surprise you with sweet treats like periodic adjustments, or variations, or a quick tea tree or lavender oil rub near the end of class. The studio is new so not crowded or smelly. Just signed up for my first annual membership and can't wait to see how much I've progressed then!",5
"I normally avoid brunch buffets as a rule; the food is never up to par and it's a cattle call. Usually a poor excuse for restaurants to make money. However, when a local friend suggested we meet here he insisted Harris Grill's brunch was legit. He had me at ""bacon trough"".

Nice patio seating and friendly service! You get a frozen mimosa (and it's not overly sweet or weak; actually tastes like a frozen mimosa) or bloody mary with the $15 all you can eat brunch. Omelets made to order, lox and mini bagels, fresh fruit, trough of well done, really quality bacon as previously mentioned. There's even pre-assembled eggs benedict, which I expected to be a mess but they were perfect. 

I wish all brunch buffets were like this. It is a tiny bit cramped when there are several people loading up plates, but everyone was understanding and laughed off the occasional bumps. Brunch is serious business, you do what you gotta do.",5
Driving the ATV was amazing -- I thought it would be a boring tour but it was fast and exciting. There were many hills and opportunities to try to hit max speed. I did the four hour tour (highly recommend). My guide (JOSH) was absolutely amazing and helped us,5
"Cons: They almost never answer their phone. The place is almost ALWAYS STACKED. Expect to wait around 20minutes for a seat during lunchtime/dinner time. The bar tenders are really loud and obnoxious (could easily be heard telling patrons to shutup in a loud sarcastic manner) and the music they play just doesnt agree with my ears. Also the entire scene is just very loud and can get uncomfortable at times when youre just trying to enjoy your meal. They dont accept Interac-debit, forcing you to use their ATM that sucks more money out your account in the form of bank fees.

Pros: The food is good. The wait times for menu turnover are more than decent especially considering just how stacked they are for lunch/dinner. And the servers are friendly and on spot.

One thing to note: they have ""coffee"" listed as an item on their menu but actually dont serve any at all whatsoever. I found this peculiar especially after our server hinted that a large amount of customers request it on a daily basis (seems like lost profit to me). 

Also DONT let the menu prices fool you. The food items are cheaper than beverages. Order around 3-4 drinks and 2-3 plates and youve already racked up a sizeable bill that doesnt include tip or your trip to the ATM fee.

Id visit again but Im not overly eager to. Ill try a few more places before I settle on this one again. They really need to do something about the noise levels though. We wouldve ordered more drinks and dessert but left earlier because our ears started ringing.",3
"A ok it is.
I thought the food was all good- but not great.
I was NOT impressed with the portion sizes, and would have preferred a bit more food in my tummy when I left.

But it was ok.",3
"Not bad - not amazing by far but not bad for Fashion Square - buyers/merchandisers have clearly done their homework on what will sell in this market and what will not,,,the merchandise really reflects that - another reviewer wrote the selection is a bit lacking but look around, most people in az consider an old navy outfit dressing up...
If you are looking for a particular item, swing by and see if they have it - I have a tendency to shop barney's online - that being said I like to get a look at an item prior to purchase - I normally swing thru to see if I can find it in person - Poor Barney's - they rarely have a wide range of sizes - and I'm actually not very impressed with the sale rack, (as compared to online) but they do have some interesting items in stock - 
As others have mentioned its a SUPER small Barney's and I am sad to say I doubt it'll make it - I've never seen anyone else in the store when I'm there!
Customer service on the first floor is a joke, don't ever expect to actually TRY ON a pair of shoes, however, upstairs its all good - nice manager in the co-op dept and super nice sales associates ready to assist 
I'd say I'd be back but I'm moving so I won't be!",3
Restaurant is clean also like that it has hint of modern touch. Tried brunch and lunch. Both were good.,4
"This was probably one of the best finds I have found in Las Vegas, and it's not on the strip! YAY! Located just south in Henderson right off HWY 215, this is such a beautiful facility.  The staff here also has the utmost value in customer service - I never experienced anywhere else in Vegas, the CS that they demonstrate here.  Highly recommend!",5
The food is so fresh and so many options.  Thank you Trinity for helping me make the perfect bowl!,5
"Michael's Pizza Bar has pizza that is virtually unmatched. The crust, sauce, everything is perfect. The prices are great and the staff is so friendly. 

I used to live in Pittsburgh and would come here regularly on Saturday afternoons with my family. The server got to know our family and we always looked forward to catching up with her. Now that I'm in Chicago with tons of pizza options, Michael's still ranks towards the very best I've had. I make sure to dine here when I come back in town. 

Do yourself a favor- start with the twistys. I'm drooling just thinking about them.",5
"This was the best plumbing company I have used in the PHX area!! Kerry was to be here between 800-0900, arrived at 0750!! most impressed and he had not started to work yet! Very nice and helpful. Got right to work and was done 2 hours later. I was guessing about $300+ for the work and it was only $240!! When someone asks me if I know any good plumbers? I can yes, Coyote Plumbing. They have 30 years in the Biz!

"Review as recipient: Tiger Lily provides some of the most beautiful and unique flower arrangements I have ever been fortunate enough to receive. They use a mixture of flowers and no two arrangements are ever exactly alike. I don't think I've ever received anything in a typical vase, but rather in tall glass jars or shallow pots. Their work really is magnificent.

Review as sender: Unfortunately, they have a policy that requires an order to exceed a certain dollar amount to qualify for delivery, even though they charge for delivery. Makes absolutely no sense and therefore the reason for a mediocre rating. 

Expect to spend more than the average florist, but upon delivery (if you qualify) the arrangement is sure to impress.",3
"I had a wonderful time at this steakhouse ordering from the bar.  
The bartender was attentive and offered me some wine tastes to see what would go best with my meal.

There was a small mistake on my appetizer, but the one that they brought me by accident was awesome and much better then what I had actually ordered so that was great.  And they took off my first glass of wine which just shows how awesome the service is.

The skirt steak I ordered was wonderful and I was almost tearful when it was gone; the side of scalloped potatoes were equally amazing.  It almost tasted like there was a hint of truffle oil.

I think that they were supposed to give me some complimentary fries, but I never got any until I called up my friend to come and join me; and then I ate some of his.
But I enjoyed the meal so much I didn't mind the few mistakes.

If I had more time I would have come back!",5
"Gameplay is great! However... in my hour and a half session... I saw my waitress 3 times. One to get my order then bring it, and one to ask if I wanted anything else (a polite no was my response). I had to ask the bartender for my check only to have my waitress sent to me immediately blaming other customers for her delay. I spent a good 20 minutes of my session waiting on co2 refills, and watching the young man in charge of that use a rifle in a nearby booth. 

I used to love this place -- it's obviously declined.",1
"I was going to give this place a 4 or 5 until I read conrads review!

Everything looked beautiful and great quality but I guess beware...

Everything was super-cheap/on sale this week, go bad economy!",3
"Deans house is where my family goes for Chinese food whenever we eat out. We usually get the dinner for three, and get rice, noodles, 3 kinds of meat, and some wonton soup. Everything is standard Chinese fare, not great but it's good. Not sure why there's so many negative reviews.",3
"I've been looking for a decent AYCE in the Vaughan region for some time now and stumbled upon a review of this place, so I decided To try it out.  This is my second time and the service never disappoints. For $24 bucks for two at lunch you couldn't go wrong. My girlfriend and I tried dynamite, spider, spicy salmon, and green dragon rolls and they were delicious. In addition to that we ordered a few off their teriyaki and fried section and the miso soup. All in all the food was great, service was excellent, and the price was reasonable. This is my spot in Vaughan if I ever crave sushi.",4
"I come here because I'm in training for work for many and I am staying in a hotel close. I had clothes that needed to be cleaned so it convenient.

I arrived last night around 6:15/6:30 to pick up the clothes I dropped off last week and they were closed. I thought it was strange because the sign on the door says they are open from 7 am to 7 pm on Thursdays....so I left empty handed.

I arrived today at 7 am (right when they open) and they were closed. But the sign on the door says they are open from 7 am to 7 pm on Fridays as well! 

I really want my clothes....I hope they will be open at some point. But besides not being open when they are supposed to, I guess I haven't had any major problems.",2
"Although there a lot of Thai places around Las Vegas, I am still looking for my one place that I can always count on. Krung Siam is ok, but not sure it is my favorite of all places. The service was ok - it was not a busy night and they somehow managed to not get our order correct, even though the server had repeated what we wanted. 

We ordered the yellow curry with tofu, beef drunken noodles, and the spicy chicken wings. The flavor for all of the dishes were good, although for medium spicy, it felt like it was more mild. Each Thai place is very different as I have been to other places that their mild was more like hot. I wish the restaurants were more consistent. For the price, the portion sizes were decent, but not huge. They also charge for extra rice. 

The one good thing is they do have happy hour drinks/beers - so go before 8p and get your pints/pitchers for a great price!",3
"I am sad that the fantastic sandwiches and soup from before are now gone. 
The food was ok but not outstanding.",3
"I was hungry. My aunt was hungry. Those were the only two reasons I went to this place while out visiting Boulder City.

The pizza portions were ridiculously huge, but y'know, there was nothing special about this place other than its cheap prices. The cheese on my slice was overly greasy and no matter what you do, NEVER order their fries because they're out to make you fat.",3
"I am definitely a fan of their tuna ahi sandwich and their fontina burger, along with their fried zucchini and garlic fries! Be sure to get there early during the weekends or after the afternoon rush!! Not going to lie I love the farm grill more than Joe's BBQ! Friendly staff, great surrounding neighborhood and atmosphere!",5
"Just got back from vaccinating and micro chipping my dogs. I usually make the trip out to the Humane Society but I searched for something closer this time and figured I'd give this clinic a try. 

I got in at 6:20am with three pets in front of me, and was out by 6:40am; with my TWO dogs fully vaccinated and microchipped. I felt awful because I forgot their collars in my other car, but the staff was super patient with me.

From receptionist, to vet techs, to veterinarian...everyone was very gentle & loving with my pups, friendly, knowledgable, and helpful. Much friendlier than I'd be if I were dealing with the public at 6am. 

2 dogs fully vaccinated and microchipped for $142?? You can bet I'll be back for my dogs' dental cleanings, not to mention all their vaccinations. I'll definitely be recommending this to everyone at the dog park & all the other fur-parents I know! 

Thank you millions!!!",5
"Unfortunately, I have to post an updated review for this Fausto's. The original was five stars, but this location has gone downhill the past year or so. 

The first thing is that they used to have three delicious salsas that I used for every meal. They were great. However, those are no more. 

Now there are only two salsas that are both pretty bad. Tonight they were so runny I couldn't even get any to stay on my chips. Sad!

To make this issue more pressing, the entrees seem to have lost all flavor and I have no delectable salsa to mask that fact. I had enchiladas and a taco and both were incredibly bland. 

This used to be a place I'd bring friends from out of town to try and now I think I may have just made my last visit. 

I just hope management reads this and fixes things because I saw other reviewers stating the same thing.",2
"Great food everytime i went there. Great service, Clean place, good price.
Good for dating. , alone, with a group of friends or Family.",5
"I purchased a home package when I moved to Vegas in April...and they delivered it to my home in VEGAS...6 months later my lamps stopped working.  I took them back to the store in VEGAS where I purchased them.  I was told that the new lamps would arrive in a week...Two weeks passed, no lamps.  I called them today...my lamps are in PA where I moved from...NOT VEGAS...They are acting like its my fault...UGH!  Its Thanksgiving week and I will have no lamps in the living room...UGH!!   Can't pick up new lamps at the store...have to have a dark home on the holiday...UGH!  they have officially lost me as a customer.",1
"All I have to say is WOW! We've been trying to come here for months. Finally got a reservation! Got the guacamole sampler (goat cheese was our favorite). Got the margarita flight (habiscus was our favorite). Had the sea scallops for my entree and it was absolutely incredible. Best scallops I've ever had. The creamed corn that it came with was super delicious. Tried the fried ice cream for dessert and it was only okay. Apparently, the jalapeño bread pudding is the dessert to get. Overall, best restaurant in CLE that we've been to.",5
"Food is alright, prices are cheap. Service isnt the best, they dont really pay attention
Food takes forever to get to the table",3
The best vintage store! The husband and wife owners and staff are so friendly and helpful. I was lucky to get their one on one attention and felt no up-sell pressure. The wife owner really wants you to leave happy. The prices are ridiculously affordable and their selection is amazing. Saw the cutest 1950s and 1960s dresses for like $30-$35. Some store on Melrose avenue in Los Angeles buys from here and then jacks up prices - might as well go directly to the source. Gotta feel pretty good supporting both local mom and pop businesses and downtown Las Vegas.,5
"Ate here a couple of years ago but unlike e by Jose andres it's a little bit harder for me to recall anything truly spectacular about the experience.  The food was good but not that memorable.  I remember the candy cart being very awesome but can't recall specifically any one dish that stood out.
The atmosphere was very serious and formal which didn't really contribute to my enjoyment of the food that much.  I remember all around us people speaking to each other in low hushed tones as if we were in an art museum rather than a restaurant.  I feel that being in a setting where you must treat your meal with such reverence detracts from the food somehow; additionally service was coldly polite so that didn't help things.
If you must, don't do the full menu, there were a lot of extras on the menu and its easy to get full before even the meat courses start.",4
Prices are pretty high but it is on the strip. A good relief from the sun.,4
"Cabo Fish Taco?  No, Cabo Fish Taco HEAVEN. This place will ROCK your mind as you take each bite with total confusion of how good a taco can taste. There aren't enough words to describe the amazing freshness and quality of the food that play a part in the spectacular creation of the flavor profile in each taco. From the complimentary corn salsa and chips to the last bite of food on your plate will leave you speechless. A giant smile  on your face says it all as you regretfully will have to leave and move on with your life. But remember one thing, you experienced the wonderful hospitality of the wait staff and the amazing food.",5
"So the service is great, the ambiance is good and the food is adequate.  An Italian place that does not make it's own meatballs.. come on. Yes I know they are bought as I have worked in the business.  Want so much better from them.",2
Love coming here on game days! Good food  and great staff!! I would recommend this place!,5
I was captivated to come inside given the neon flashing bunny sign. The place is quite small but cozy nonetheless. We ordered the eggs florentine (spinich eggs benny) and eggs hemingway (smoked salmon eggs benny) which came with salad on the side. The food did take quite a bit of time to come but our waiter was a pleasure. He was witty and made the dining experience enjoyable. The portion of the meal was decent with the poached eggs done nicely and the salad dressing was good.,4
"I recently stayed at this hotel with a group of eight gentlemen as part of a bachelor party weekend.  The location was great, rooms tastefully decorated, and the service at the front desk was top-notch.  The only issue the group had was the poor quality toilet paper they provided in the rooms.  After some late evenings, lack of dietary constraint, and countless kilometers walked sightseeing, the inferior toilet paper left several group members chaffed and sore.  I would recommend this hotel, but might suggest bringing in a few roles of nice toilet paper or hope they invest in some higher quality supplies.",4
"How is it possible I have not written a review for this place? From the check-ins, tips and uploaded pictures, I could swear I moved a cot into the front space of the restaurant to camp out. It's obvious that Pho/noodle houses are a rarity in Scottsdale. I'm not talking about fancy schmancy because any Asian or noodle lover knows the authentic noodle houses aren't about the pretty packaging. It's what is inside. This gem hands down is consistent good food, good service and a price tag that doesn't dent your wallet just because you live in the most livable city of AZ. 

Pho is the perfect warm, hearty meal when you seek comfort. You get abundant fresh veggies consisting of the usual basil and sprouts, fresh homemade noodles and flavorful broth. I will note that even the veggie pho is incredible with the baby bok choy, broccoli, and just add tofu to the order for your protein substitute. My other go to dish is the item V1, grilled pork and shrimp noodle salad bowl. The grilled flavor of the meats scream such goodness. The egg roll and veggies are perfect crunch. With this kind of healthy and taste that doesn't disappoint, I can't imagine picking greasy food over this kind of option. Let's be honest, the only time grease is an option is for those late night outings. Pho is the perfect hangover cure!!

Like any place that offers attentive service and food that never fails to please, you will have a crowd. But the staff is always efficient in cleaning tables and turning it around in time to be out the door to punch in your time clock if needed. I do adore how the entire family and staff take pride in this love nest. They want you to stay and you are never short of a friendly personable greeting by anyone. Why would you eat anywhere else?",5
"Let me start by saying, I have not truly had a UTL experience yet; however, my mother and her friends went to the UTL and I requested that she bring back a dessert for me.  She called me and read all of the delicious sounding desserts, I selected the Lemon Bundt Cake for her to bring back.  When the dessert was presented to my mother and her friends, they thought the cake looked very familiar to a ""Sam's Club"" cake or ""Costco"".  They asked if the desserts were homemade, particularly the Lemon Bundt Cake, the server stated that the cake is ""outsourced"".  

When I opened the take home box with the Lemon Bundt Cake, I looked at my mother and said to her, ""This looks like a Costco's or Sam's Club cake.""  My mother kind of chuckled and said ""that is exactly what we thought.""  I asked how much I owed her and she said it cost $5.95 but don't worry about it.   I am extremely disappointed and slightly disgusted that the UTL charges $6 for a slice of Sam's Club or Costco's cake.  My expectation exceeded the UTL's potential to produce a high quality dessert.

On a better note, I will say that my mother had a pleasant dining experience, sans the dessert, and I am not opposed to personally visiting the UTL; I just will not order dessert.",2
Cool atmosphere and good coffee and food. I had an croissant sandwich and cafe mocha and enjoyed every bit of it.,5
Best sushi in the state! We have ordered so many different dishes and they are all outstanding. I would eat here every day if possible. 10 stars.,5
"Just celebrated my birthday with dinner at Gallagher's.  Yes it was really good. We were seated close to the kitchen and boy did I have a big reminder of what hard work restaurant work is!!!  
I mostly wanted to comment on the service. It was exceptional. Bryan was our server and Mikey was his helper(?). They were so nice and friendly. Came around just enough. 
We're local so don't know when we will return. There are so many more steak houses we need to try!! Thanks Bryan and Mikey for singing ""Happy Birthday""",5
"The Big Jim's omelette has made this location of the chain up to five stars. The omelette only has white meat chicken , cheese and mushrooms inside, but it was that Big Jim mushroom sauce that gets poured over the top that took this dish literally over the top. It was creamy and dreamy and a great suggestion by the purple tinted hair very nice waitress. Just a good flavor in every bite. The solid hash browns and English Muffin rounded out at nice breakfast at about $12. Protein pancakes also still getting good reviews.

The only issue here is that they use a Wheat batter for pancakes and waffles. They need to find some buttermilk and then it could crack the Big 5 in Scottsdale.",5
"I have a Jeep SRT and it was wrecked in december.  The paint work was excellent.The body shop manager and staff were all very nice.  When i picked the car up the mechanical work was not done properly and i noticed it immediately. A $17,000 repair and they didnt bother to sufficiently road test the car.  They totally missed a bad strut and control arm. The noise these defective items made sounded like the front end was falling off the car.  After 5 total months and almost $20,000 the car still isnt right...yes, u read correctly, almost $20,000.  NOT ONCE did any of the management attempt to make this misearable situation better.  Also know, they acknowledged the repair was wrong after i pointed it out so dont think im a bad oversensitive consumer...they admitted the problems were real.  Any business can make a mistake....its what happens after the mistake that matters...and sadly nothing positive happened on any level.  Nice people are great...but when its work on my car, id rather have someone who knows what they are doing....sadly it appears no one here does...id trust jiffy lube with this car before id take it back here.",2
"Mache Bacchus is amazing.  Entering thru a fine wine shop, you can pick up something reasonably price.  Then, proceed to your table.

On the outdoor deck, you'll be treated to live music, and a spectacular view of the lake.  Although man made, you would never know.  Alas, I became fooled many of time.

This is particular a good choice for a romantic evening, or comfortable and nice enough for a group of friends for an afternoon.  Delightful.

I recommend the Steak Frites ($25), Moules Mariniere (mussels, $19), and the Roasted Chicken ($22).

Wonderful, wonderful place.  Also, it is miles from the strip, and provides ample parking.",5
I love going here because it is near my house! Usually I'll  call and walk over. The ladies are super friendly and the prices are fair. You wouldn't expect the salon to be so huge but up the stairs they essentially have the whole top floor of the two storey building. It is a super nice loft. They do spray tans and massages there too!,4
Beautiful decor! Cozy atmosphere. The food and drinks are delish AND well priced!! The waitstaff is super friendly. Definitely my favorite spot in Monkland village. Highly recommended!!,5
"Qdoba what happened!!!! You guys came to Cleveland After success in Mentor and did a great job. The food and customer service was fantastic when you first opened. Now you get sub par meat that has been held in a hot unit for who knows how long. Not that clean anymore. No more foot traffic and you have closed locations in the area. Please rethink your community presence because you have a great product going for you or shall I say had. I know I know I may be harsh but someone needs to wake up the owner and get this place thriving, yeah Chipotle has a strong following in EVERY community it touches but think about the other half they are not touching. People with tolerance to spices, Families, elderly that want to sit and watch that hanging tv of yours. Get it right or move along....",1
"The place is nice and clean, we were seated immediately. The staff was nice and very attending. I ordered a pizza and I must say it was delicious. I try pizza everywhere I go and I must say this is on my top 10 list. The crust was perfectly charred and flavorful. My wife had the steak sandwich with onions and actually liked it(she is picky). Great service great food and over all a great restaurant.",5
"One of the food places inside Desoto Central Market. 

Loved sitting at the counter and watching them shuck my oysters. So many selections, so fresh, so many sauces. 

They have happy hour too.",5
"Checked into trump towers for our honeymoon. We traveled from austin Texas to experience Las Vegas. 

Positive
Rooms are spacious with a large bathroom. TV inside the mirror in the powder room. Beautiful views of the strip. Heated pool and awesome fitness room. Complimentary water and valet service. Fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious and you can never go wrong with starbucks coffee. Hotel shampoo and conditioner are larger bottles that smell very good. The shower is huge and the bed is very comfortable. 

Negative 

We checked in and noticed a very loud wind noise in the room. When we called the front desk they said its common because it's windy out. We requested someone come look and they sent an engineer who already had replacement parts in hand when he entered. He explained the vent was broken and he replaced it which immediately dulled the wind noise. He said its common for this hotel and has a few more rooms to go to with the same issue. 

Room service food quality was very poor. Pizza appeared to be frozen with small amount of toppings. Calamari, I could have made at home from a frozen bag. Very oily sautéed spinach. 

Shower temperature was finicky. It was either scaling hot or super cold. Too lengthy period to get water temp to my liking. Similar issues with my friends in a neighboring room. 

Minor Stains on the curtains and major on the carpet when you enter the room. 

Hotel manager delivered our baggage then proceeded to disclose that the train is very loud when passing the hotel. Boy was he right. Once at night and early morning the training sounded its horn and wow we got out of bed early. I'm not sure if the hotel will remedy that eventually in the future, but had we known about the train we probably wouldn't have stayed in this hotel. 

Over all we had a pleasant experience. We were not in the hotel much but for 190 a night we get what we pay for. 

Nice staff and very helpful valet.",3
"Duffs famous wings are famously not that great. They are expensive for what you get and the flavours are really poor compared to say St Louis or I wings on Queen. My girlfriend and I have been here several times, each time expecting better, but do not get the other Yelpers recommendations. Poor fries, poor wings, average service and an average setting/ ambiance. 2 out of 5. If u love great wings try elsewhere!",2
"Great overall presentation. Friendly staff, great food selection. Just had the pho noodle soup for their soft opening and it was delicious. Just needed more flavor in the broth and separation of the noodles if you ask me",5
"Attend a retirement dinner for a friend here in Las Vegas.   I was gladly surprised at this beautiful dining room ... the location is downtown and at first I was a bit worried, but they offered friendly valet parking and a great full service bar.   The food was gourmet and delicious.   We all had a great time and would recommend this gem of a banquet hall to everyone!   Bon Appetite!",5
"A few months ago someone told me the best chips and salsa and guacamole was at some Blanco place at The Clarendon. I went there to find that it had closed. I was told the chef went over to Otro Cafe.

I eventually found it and went in to get some chips and salsa. First, they neglected to tell me they didn't actually have salsa. They had a green Chile salsa and a Chipotle salsa, but not the typical chunky salsa with tomatoes and such. Second, somehow the chips were stale, yet the bag managed to leave grease stains on my counter at home. The guacamole was good, though. Most people put too much garlic powder in their recipe, but this was just right.

I haven't tried their menu yet, but for the price I paid (like $8) for stale chips and not salsa, I'm not sure I'm willing to venture a night out with friends to overpay for  food that may or may not be quality.",3
"The staff is super nice and as tourist oriented this is, I like that they keep lanes open for locals too!",5
I feel you can't go wrong here.  Everything here looks greet.  Been here a few times and so far everything I've had was good.  No disappoint so far.  It can get busy and you might have to stand in line depending on the time.,5
"Fun scene, great place, met lots of cool people. Open and airy with lots of dance space except no one was dancing. Why? The music was lackluster. My friends and I tried to dance but it was short lived. More trance, house, even some techno would get things moving. Despite the boring music I had fun but doubt I'll be going back too soon.",2
"My veggie riverboat (hoagie) was soggy and fell apart. They should use denser and fresher bread for their sandwiches.

If you want healthy food, this is not the place. The menu was almost all meat sandwiches, pizza, and deep-fried appetizers.",2
"What a wonderful place! First off, beautiful restaurant especially the outdoor patio. Staff was very friendly. For drinks, I got the el diablo azul and it was sooo good. Great ratio of liquor to juice. We got the queso to start which did not have an awful artificial taste that often accompanies queso. Perfect way to start the meal. Then we got two burritos the death by ruru and the steak burrito. Death by ruru was very spicy but both burritos were huge and delicious. Prices were very reasonable. Definitely walked away full and happy. Did not try tacos but will def be back. 

TL;DR - lots of great food at an affordable price, come hungry",5
"Let's get the first thing straight. I love fish. But I hate cooking it indoors for obvious reasons. Now let's talk about how awesome the fish store is. Great sandwiches or plates  made with any kind of fish you can think of. The two I've tried is grouper and tuna. They make the sandwhich with nice fresh bread, lightly fried fish, a pesto sauce and lemon. I usually add acacia do to that (make sure you ask for it in the sandwhich otherwise they give it to you on the side for some reason.) I love the hole in the wall look and mom+pops feel of this place too. Must try for fish lovers in Toronto.",5
"Serving up the shawarma box like a boss, great overall  experience, food was very tasty, ingredients were fresh and portions were more than satisfactory. I recommend the chicken box but the chicken poutine is a no brainer.",5
"I'm really into gourmet burgers and this place hit the spot.

I went a bit different and I tried the Elk burger w/ Sweet Potato Fries.  The burger it self came out really good.  It was very flavorful and lean, good seasoning, and the toppings were great.

This place has pre-defined choices that you pick from which indicate which toppings go onto your burger.  For example, I got the Man Cave (Monetary jack cheese, Caramelized onions, Bacon, and BBQ sauce.)  It went very well with the Elk.

The Sweet Potato Fries were not that great to be honest.  I would say they were a tad bit dry lacking seasoning.  But hey, maybe it's a preference thing.  You might like them.

Service was great.  Our waiter was really nice and a chill dude easy to get along with.  

I would suggest this place for the burger alone!",4
"The tattoo lady did my eyebrows they were both different she use black color instead of medium brown. My lips got a infection with the tattoo in my lips had to get treatment for the batería with a doctor. Also, did eyeliner and it did not stay it was a mess a have to paid a professional to fix this. This lady uses the same needle to tattoo. Please be aware don't go their.",1
"Best wings in This area, I don't say that lightly. They beat Buffalo Wild Wings winking lizard and quaker steak and lube hands down! THAT BEING SAID, you are a bar with food so your main attraction should be your drink selection and atmosphere. Being that property in middlefield village, in Geauga county is selling for over 30k an acre it's time to update your draft list from bud light, Miller light , coors etc. I think they had one craft beer. I had to educate the staff on what an IPA was, and more than once was simply ignored upon arrival. If your looking for some good bar food Togo or enjoy a good dive bar, this is your place. If your looking for a place out with good service and even a subpar beer selection, look elsewhere...",2

We will be back but hopefully to find faster service.",4
"Nice staff.  Fast service.  Free drink.  What more could you ask?

I stopped here on the way home and knocked another Bucky's off my to visit list.

Location is a bit of a pain and parking is a definite drag, but I like to park in and go in and talk with the folks rather than just drive through!",4
"There is one thing I am a HUGE stickler on when it comes to hot yoga studios: Cleanliness. As if sweating like a rainforest in a studio with twenty other people isn't enough to get your OCD flaring, Modo does an immaculate job keeping everything sanitized and clean for your comfort. I have been highly impressed with the well-kept maintenance of the studio, everything from the lobby to the hot room itself. The atmosphere in the lobby is cozy, welcoming, and a great hub to socialize with fellow studio members and meet instructors themselves. There is free tea and coffee (win!) for those who need a pick me up or are refreshing themselves after a class. The hot room is comfortable and nothing that is too scorching. The best part of the studio are the instructors, to which a range of them will pass through and each offer very unique, different vibes to every class. While I used to be a person who preferred one and only one instructor, I have learned to adapt to different expectations and experiences with different instructors here. Everyone is friendly and helpful of your skill level with yoga, this is one place where you can literally just be yourself!",5
"Dustin gave us quick and efficient help with setting up my wife's new S7, and merging 2 accounts with 3 lines saving us over $100/mo.

Been here 3 different times and each visit was frustration free and every person knew what they were doing.",5
"The kobe beef is awesome!!! 

I came here alone at 4 so I sat at the bar. All my items were cooked for me which was great! I didn't have to worry about charring my meat. 

I got the Kobe beef, spicy garlic short rib, bulgogi, and the beef toro. I pretty much liked everything except for the highly recommended beef toro. It was extremely dry. I'd probably opt for the brisket instead. 

Anyways I had a pretty good experience. The male server was extremely attractive and all the servers kept checking on me to see if everything was okay.",5
"We really enjoy coming here. It's the perfect place to go before or after catching a movie at Stonecrest. The tableside guacamole is really good, we always have to get that! They have a nice variety of tacos and have the choice of a corn soft shell! The chimichanga's are super good too and HUGE...prepare to get a to do box!",4
"Chef James Trees and his incredible team are killing it! A complete scratch kitchen...something that is tough to do. 

Fresh baked homemade bread (delish) with butter and burrata, all of our appetizers were well thought out in their flavor combinations - Yellow tail crudo- light, fresh and delicious. 

I had the Lasagnette Nero - outstanding! Huge chunks of lobster, perfectly made squid ink pasta with a little chewiness dressed in flavorful red sauce. I can still taste it! 

The Spaghetti with polpette. Again...outstanding. The flavor!!! So incredible.

My fave dessert: the butterscotch budino, though everything was fantastic, that budino won my heart. Next time I'm getting my own...I honestly can't share it and will have to stab anyone's hand who tries to eat mine. (And I usually share everything!)

Thanks to Chef James and the rest of the awesome chefs in the kitchen and staff for such a beautiful eating experience. I will be back...again and again. I haven't felt this passionate about wanting to return to a specific restaurant in a very long time. 

Cheers to you all for creating such a special gem here in Las Vegas.",5
"Absolutely one of the best dining experiences I have had in Charlotte. Bernard, the head chef and owner, makes sure your dining experience is always truly exceptional.

Global is currently located off the beaten path, but definitely a hidden a gem. The atmosphere, environment and experience make for a perfect evening. Always very accommodating, I have hosted two corporate dinners at Global and everyone in attendance has praised the service, food and experience.",5
I know I'm a pizza snob coming fron NY area but this pizza (with burrata)is outstanding!  Cooked purfectly with fresh ingredients.  We tried it a few days ago and wanted it again before we left. Service great and prices reasonable.  Highly recommended!,5
"Bogart's is just ALWAYS reliable.  They carry all types of food, including my much needed Natural Balance that PetSmart doesn't carry.  Their prices on food are very competitive, and they participate in the buy 10, get 1 free programs for many brands.  The staff is also really knowledgeable about dog food.  When my dog was going through a ""vomiting and pooping every type of food imaginable phase"", they made really good suggestions about which foods would be too rich for her system, which ones are reliable, and which ones are overrated.  Hence my discovery of Natural Balance.

Bogart's has a self wash area that they only charge $10 to use.  They also have a stamp card for buy 10 washes, get one free.  Always a good go-to in between grooming sessions for my lab.  They also have a groomer on site, but I have never used their groomer.  I'm just too attached to my other groomer!

The doggie bakery is really fun.  They have cookies, will make dog birthday cakes, and even pizza slices for dogs!",5
Some of the best beef jerky I've ever tasted!  We got to meet these guys at Country Christmas. They have so many interesting and tasty flavors and the staff is super friendly.,5
"I go here at least once a week.

Amusingly, it's basically a Subway with Tex-Mex, but higher quality.  The meat is all organic which makes it actually pretty tasty.   They do a pretty good job at moving the line through too and never have an issue with custom orders (extra rice, extra corn, etc).

Always get a similar item, and regardless of where you go, most Chipotle's are similar.   The corn might be a little hotter in some places versus others, but that's about it.

Believe me.  You could eat here every day for weeks on end.   I have before.  And it's just.... so... yummy.",4
"Decent food, decent staff, but its a stark corporate echo chamber.  Not a nice place to be.",2
Wanted a new experience for New Years... friends and I decided on Stock Bar...a fantastic experience ! The service was awesome - my barman Chris  went above and beyond making sure or drinks were full and we could enjoy the entertainment. A lively crowd was entertained by a host of the hottest guys in North America. Champaign toast... Buffett... beautifully decorated bar to bring in the new year all for a very reasonable price! We are already planning a return to bring in 2018!,5
"I have seen a ton of movies at South Point (closest theater to my house). There are pluses and minuses to coming here.
On the plus side:
1. Lots of free parking both in front (closest to the theater if you park on the south end of the outdoor lot). Plus there is a parking structure on the few days of rain in Vegas so you can pared and walk to the theater without getting wet.
2. Stadium seating so you can sit behind the guy who is 6'4"" and not have your view blocked. The aisles are wide enough so that you don't have to stand up every time the guy 2 seats away decides he needs to pee at the most dramatic moment in the film.
3. They have days with reduced rates for seeing films. Plus they participate with Movie Pass so I get in without paying anything for the movie (just the monthly rate for Movie Pass - if you don't know about it, check it out right away).
4. Large concession stand area.
5. Lots of restaurants and food stands to get a bite to eat either before or after a film.
6. Lots of screens so they usually have the latest hot film playing
On the negative side:
1. The movie theater is upstairs in the back, so it's a schlep no matter where you park and come in.
2. They don't have the reclining chairs, just over sized leather. Comfortable but not the latest and greatest in movie house seating.
3. They never play the smaller indie films.",4
Great flavors fresh fruit .. New owners as I found out . Had some negative reviews before but know is worth the trip!,5
"great paninis and salads, very friendly service. they are always busy and for a good reason, the food is amazing.",5
"I had an unpleasant experience here today which I will not go into detail about but the manager Peter was so accommodating and professional!  He took care of it right away and made sure I left happy!  Great customer service, Peter!",5
We had a great meal for my husband's birthday! Always good food! The staff are really friendly and always around to see if you need anything else. Really love it here!!,5
What a great place! This was really unexpected: high quality seafood in high quantity and at a great price. Service is quick and courteous. The selection of sushi and other seafood was more diverse than any other buffet I've been to.,5
Ordered the Las Vegas combo. Such a variety. Enough to feed 3-4 people. Staff was fine and the atmosphere was great. Worth checking it out.,5
"Had an opportunity to eat at the breakfast buffet on feb 28th, there is not much to say except, It was horrible.. The food was unbelievably bad, and tasteless.. Eggs Benedict should at the least have a sauce that can be identified.. This one was pale yellow, yet there was no taste to it at all, lemon was completely absent.. I have no idea what it was made from, but it certainly was not lemon or eggs.. While most things can be explained for bad food, stupidity is not an excuse.. The section that was serving the fresh bowls of fruits, water melon, cantaloupe, and pineapple sitting in large stainless steel bowls, packed in ice, had the HEAT LAMPS on.?. Actually had to tell them that they were ON.. Needless to say the fruit was hot on top and cold on the bottom.  This was my last trip to the 'green valley ranch' anything..",2
"At first I was uncomfortable, nervous, and for a few seconds forgot why were there in the first place. Unfamiliar places tend do this to me and I'm sure it's a disorder of some sort. So as my eyes adjusted to the dark lit space, I began to admire the wood floors, exposed brick, pulsating light fixtures, and swanky euro furniture. Then my eyes were transfixed on the sparkle behind the bar. Each bottle of booze glistened like fresh cut jewels and was displayed with precise intention to tempt and I wanted them all! Although many of the people sitting at the bar were drinking canned beer PBR to be exact. This is a cool bar and I wanted a cool drink and the choice was a dirty martini. So as we sipped our drinks and moved from one side of the bar to the other and back again admiring every detail. We nodded our heads in approval and  departed delightfully impressed with the outcome of the long awaited Side Bar. A spot we will visit again and again.",5
"This place is more of a 3.5 than 4 in my opinion. First I love modern things so this place def. Scream modern. Love the design and being there just makes me happy. 

The few times I was here I didn't recall having issue with my servers. We went with big groups so taking a bit longer than normal for dinner to me is understandable. 

I do however have mixed reviews with the food. The last time i was here the food was extremely salty. I love salt and like to add salt on my meal but it was beyond reasonable. On the other hand...the last time I had the buns they were yummy!

I also like that this place have mixed crowd which is another thing i look for when I go out.",4
"Great location! Staff were friendly and the food is always great at Burrito Boyz. Definitely the smallest location I've ever been to with no seating at all, so that's something to keep in mind for those wanting to dine in somewhere. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the shrimp and sweet potato mix burrito I got. 

TIP: When I checked in on yelp, I got a free bag of chips and salsa! First time I've seen this at Burrito Boyz--free food is always a welcomed surprise in my books.",4
"I forgot to take a picture before I started, but the contents of my bowl should explain enough. Simply awesome. Recommended definitely.",5
"Talk about nostalgia. Stopping in at Smeeks was like going back in time to all those awkward childhood days. Minus the awkwardness. 

This shop is adorable and their selection is even cuter. Charleston Chews, Pez dispensers, Salt Water Taffy, etc. All classics from back in the day. They also have a wall of old toys...the silly trinkets that you'd be willing to spend your whole allowance on as a kid. $5 for a miniature rotary phone? Of course! A mini Etch-A-Sketch to hang from your key chain? Hell yeah! Smeeks is bringing back the good old days.

Anyway, this place is great. Silly toys, tasty candy, and super cute gifts for anyone. I will totally be back.",4
"What can I say about this amazing place?

I took my future wife here on a beautiful night in CLE and introduced her to the wonderful things this city has to offer.  The entrance is warm and inviting and the decor makes you feel like you've stepped into a new urban world.

We started off the night with french bread with pig paste, and I had the duck pasta.  All local ingredients, the best part of the meal besides the taste was the portion control.  Too often you go to a restaurant and they overload your plate with food...not at Greenhouse Tavern.

While it may be pricey and a once in a while treat, it's worth every penny to come to GHT.  Chef Sawyer and crew have done an amazing thing on E. 4th Street.

Come to the CLE and have a wonderful night out at Greenhouse Tavern!",5
"I came here with my wife and coworkers. The ambiance and show were good.   I got the noodles, steak, chicken and salmon.  Everything was good, no complaints.  However,  I think Benihana is better.",4
"If I could I would give them zero stars. The owner of the restaurant said that he could not honor a corporate coupon that had no expiration date. The woman, Marilyn, that helped me with my order was rude and loud. This store has lost all of my business and all of my company's business.",1
"First off go to the one on Harvard Ave off I-77 in Cleveland. The others aren't nearly as good or giving in their portions. its open 24/7 every Friday and Saturday and I can tell you that you will hear the funniest conversations between all races. The food is delicious, the decor outdated and the staff ambivalent at best...but the food is AMAZING. If you go on 2 for Tuesday or 3 for Friday be prepared for the food to be a little cold as its pre-made. Just stick the meat in an oven at 200 for 10 mins and it will be fine. I love this place and go once every two weeks. Give them a try and support your locally owned establishments.",5
"Ben is amazing! Came in from LA with my bestie and fiancé for last minute Vegas trip. Found this place right outside the strip. Ben was so helpful, threw in a free leg massage and told me some very useful info regarding an injury. Very attentive,  patient, thoughtful, and present. Highly recommend this place!!",5
"A Yelp Talk query called my attention to the fact that I'd never posted a review, even though I've enjoyed this spot at Tivoli several times over the years. Yes, it is a Cigar Lounge, housing a large humidor with excellent stogies, but it is more, and worth exploring, even if you don't smoke cigars. 

Of course they have a wide selection of single malts, cognac and typical spirits which accompany puffing away; they also have a full bar. The decor is dark and rich, and seating is comfortable; very men's clubby feeling to me, in a good way. 

Staff has always been knowledgeable and welcoming, friends who dig cigars like the variety, and the live music we have caught at times added an extra cool vibe. A nice place to have a nightcap in Tivoli. 

* cigars to suit any taste or budget * 

** nice selection of single malts, whiskey, cognac, and full bar **

*** knowledgeable, friendly staff ***

**** live music some evenings ****",4
"We had breakfast on mothers day, waffles, eggs with potatos all very good.",4
"I was super hyped about trying Bobbly Flay's restaurant since I've been watching him on The Food Network for a very long time. We were a party of four and our bill (with tip) came to $400 and this is what we got..
We loved the jalapeño bread in the bread basket but the jalapeño corn bread crumbled in our hands and was dry.
Sophie's cobb salad (good and different but I would not order it again).
Goat cheese dip (loved it)
The regular margaritas were okay but the pear margarita was delicious.
New York strip steak was dry in the middle and my daughter-in-law left a lot of it on her plate and did not want to take any of it home.
Ribeye steak was not a good cut of meat at all.  It was gristly and had a lot of fat. My husband didn't care to eat all of it and said he's had a lot better at other places.
My son and I had the coffee rubbed filet mignon and it was excellent.
The sides are additional. 
The twice baked potato was good.
The tamale was not very good and was not finished.
The corn and cilantro was pretty tasty.

I so wanted to love this restaurant and am sad that I am compelled to write this review. We think that a fair price for the quality of food should have been about $150. The margaritas were very over priced and small as well.

Our servers were pleasant and professional.

I can now check this off my bucket list and we will not be going back.  :(",3
So far I love this gym! I was previously going to FitnessWorks off 101 and Camelback and fell in love with the many variety of classes they offered. I moved to north side of town and reviewed many gyms until I found EOS in Peoria. Trainers are awesome and gym has awesome machines. Evening does get pretty packed. Reason I gave only four is due to classes being a bit on the odd side. Other then that love this gym,4
I locked the only set of keys in the trunk of my husbands car. We called Albert and immediately he put our minds at ease by stating he could get them out. He met us super fast and had them out in a jiffy! Super awesome dude!,5
"This place is my favorite place to get really inexpensive breakfast; I feel it's sort of an under-rated little spot.  I always get the one of the cheapest breakfast options on the menu, which includes two eggs, home fries, and toast.  The home fries are made from freshly chopped potatoes and have added pepper and onions, which is cooked to perfection.  You won't be receiving pre-packaged hash browns here.  They also have ITALIAN toast, which I love - since other places usually carry only wheat, white, or rye.  Sure, it's a little dirty inside, and I've even went down into the basement to use the restroom one time and felt like I was in Amityville horror - but I made it out and never saw a bug.  I've also never had a bad experience with the food.",4
Love coming here! Staff is always kind and welcoming unlike most nail salons in Las Vegas. Always willing to take last minute appointments. They do not rush through your service and take their time. They pride themselves on customer service and are always asking if we are okay or need a drink. Back in May they even had mimosas and snacks on Mothers Day! Very thoughtful. This is my bi-weekly spot!,5
"The dining commons excels in offering an impressive array of desserts, beverages, and salad bar options but could use a boost to its main entree selections. Here's my beef with the DC: there's a sandwich station that boasted a menu with a pesto caprese option. Being that I love caprese (and it was the only vegetarian option), it was the logical choice to go caprese. Come to find out, the ""pesto"" is actually pesto mayo and there is no basil on the sandwich! You simply cannot omit basil from caprese. It's one of the main goddamn ingredients! I made do with lettuce instead, and my sad faux caprese ended being okay for a light lunch snack. 

Besides the salad bar and the sandwich station, there's a pizza and pasta bar and what looked like a Chinese food section. I grabbed some fries that were set up to a hot dog station to finish up my main course. 

Dessert is where it's at! There was brownies, cupcakes, cookies, and a Dryer's ice cream machine complete with chocolate sprinkles waiting to be scooped up. The brownies and ice cream were yummy. Beverages available include a Nestle hot chocolate machine, coffee, soda, juice, and lemon water to name a few. I was super impressed that they had chocolate and vanilla soymilk on standby!

When you're all done eating, there's a conveyor belt where students drop off all their dishes. I'd compare the quality of the food at the dining commons to EDR food or any other cafeteria type place. Most things are just okay, but there are a few standouts. My lunch date got a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce and stuffing, and she absolutely loved her food.

"Delicious breakfast. We had ricotta french toast and a Florentine Benedict. I didn't read the menu closely and when I had to send the Benedict back because it had ham (my fault, ) the owner, Carmen, could not have been nicer about making me another, and he added mushrooms too. Also, very clean.",5
"The Trump is AWESOME!

I am a born and raised Las Vegas Native. Now that I live outside of the state, this is the only place I stay when I come into town. My last trip to the strip was in March for my 22nd birthday and Spring Break. I went with some college friends and we absolutely loved our stay!

There are magnificent chandelier's hanging from the ceiling that greet you when you walk into the lobby making the lobby feel regal and ooze with classiness. For some of my friends who had never been to Las Vegas, this made us feel like we had arrived for the best Spring Break yet. Our room was spacious and beautiful with a great view! 

In addition to the beautiful interior design, the staff was excellent! Everyone was friendly and greeted us when we walked into the lobby, bar, pool area, etc. The customer service is through the roof and we felt extremely comfortable and well cared for. We went out to some of the top night clubs and either walked or took a taxi back to the hotel- The Distance isn't too far. We all loved the bathroom! With a bunch of girls getting ready to go out, the large mirrors and space made getting ready fun and enjoyable (rather than squishing for mirror space).

I will recommned the Trump Hotel to anyone. We are already looking into booking again in the next couple months!",5
"Roughly a week ago our a/c unit went down.  We checked into a Courtyard by Marriott for the night.  Once we were told this wouldn't be a quick fix, we decided the family deserved an upgrade for 1-night to escape the heat.  Boy, are we glad we did.

So, our family of 4 and 100-lb lab checked in to Mountain Shadows for the evening. This hotel is gorgeous!  Uber sexy yet extremely friendly, approachable, and could not have been more dog friendly if they wanted to be.  I think our lab wanted to stay!

Great hotel and we look forward to returning next year for a staycation or two and will recommend this hotel to others!",5
Gorgeous hotel. The drinks were the best on the strip and the bartender remembers your drink and name. Service was excellent. Very clean large rooms nicely decorated not your cookie cutter rooms like other chain hotels. Extra large Jacuzzi tub fits two and then some! I loved the free valet parking that was quick and convenient. The concierge gave us a tip for a few restaurants off the strip and they did not disappoint. Very accommodating staff as we had friends who checked in the following night and we asked they be on the same floor and they were able to make it happen. Ask and you shall receive at this place! We will definately be returning again.,5
"i love coming here because Pauline is amazing! But I barely got my nails done on dec 31st and two nails broke already with little to no force. So I decided to wake up early to get them fixed before work. This damn lady tells me I have to come back because it's too early. Mind you, they open at 9am, I came at 10am. Why are you open if no one can do nails that early?",1
The ordering online was fast and easy.  My order arrived fast and hot exactly the way I wanted it.  The delivery person was polite and friendly.  This was a rare occasion when my family was gone and I was alone and super hungry. For once I got to order what I wanted with just the toppings I wanted and it was perfect and absolutely delicious.  Thank you dominoes for making my night awesome!,5
Do not come here. Dishonest management. Offers the 10% off yelp deal to get customers in and does not honor it. Just shook his head and said no without any explanation.,1
"Love this place! Great smoothie and juices, as well as amazing sandwich's and salads! Been coming here for almost 10 years!",5
We've been a few times now and enjoy the food very much.  Service can be a little slow as they are quite busy - but that happens.  Spicy Tuna - down the road has essentially the same menu and they're half as busy.  My feeling is the rolls are a cut above...and the service is better.,4
"An interesting old B&B that has some history and is supposedly haunted too. The bar has some patine to it. If the walls could talk they'd have some stories I'm sure.  The main dining area was cozy. When we arrived there were some ladies playing cards at one table adding to the charm of this establishment.

On this visit I had the French dip sandwich. It was served with a side of au jus and lightly battered steak fries.  The sandwich fantastic. The roll was fresh with ample portion of thinly carved roast beef, grilled onions and melted provolone cheese. The au jus was steaming hot and rich with beef flavor.  Perfect for dipping into.

Ive been here a few times for lunch and enjoy their good service. The food quality is high and the dining area is clean and tidy.",4
Grilled chicken on sourdough swoon. I love all of their food. And it's a late night drive thru. Lots of healthy options.,5
Best vegan food I've tried so far. Curry was a little spicy at a three but tasted amazing! We ate so fast I couldn't take a picture! Staff was on point with service and water refills. Def check this place out of you get a chance.,5
Super nice young kids working here. Easy safe parking and a genuinely fun hangout for the kids. Off nights are not very crowded.,5
"Delicious Food!! Vegan options are a must for me, thank goodness for this place!",5
"This location is ok. The Genius Bar representatives are courteous but wait times are crazy. To book an appointment online is nearly impossible!  There have been times throughout the year where there are absolutely no appointments available and they book about 5 or 7 days out. I would be online trying to book for 7 days from now and if you aren't online as soon as it goes live (I don't even know what time that happens) you won't get an appointment. Talk about crazy!!!

I believe Apple doesn't have enough stores to supply their customers with the service they desire in Canada. For example, in December and January pray your phone does not break because it's a hassle to get any type of appointment for weeks. 

The only thing keeping me with Apple is easy user ability and the fact that I also use their computers since I do graphic design. Perhaps a competitor should tailor to this market and we all might switch.",2
"I have never been to an auto sales dealership where the staff made it so easy to buy a truck. From looking for trucks to financing, it was definitely an easy process. Thanks to Yaned and Israel for making it happen :) thank you!",5
"Just like mom makes. The family goes here and we order various dishes and just share. So delicious. If you are new to the cuisine, the staff are very friendly and will help with questions and suggestions.  We have sought out Cambodian restaurants in Seattle, Portland, etc...and this is one of the greats!",5
Food is to spicy for me.  Plus I hate that I have to go in the store to pay for my food if I forgot cash.,1
Absolutely love their double double burger loaded with animal sauce. Will definitely be coming back in the future.,5
"An honest mechanic shop.

My 99 Jeep Cherokee wouldn't start the mechanic originally diagnosed it as needing a new computer. We were looking at $1,025 parts and labor. After we discussed it with the mechanic we were resolved to our fate. However, the mechanic went the extra mile after we left and looked more into it, on top of the 3 hours he had already spent. He found it was a bad crank sensor replaced and the computer worked.  They could have gone ahead with the expensive repair and replaced the $20 sensor unbeknownst to me but they didn't. They spent at least 4 hours diagnosing my jeep for a $232 repair. This is not my 1st time taking my jeep to this shop and they have had the opportunity time and time again to charge me for an expensive repair when it was something cheap. They are an honest shop.",5
"After reading several reviews re: wait times, we decided to try this place right at 5 p.m. when it opened for an early birthday dinner. Overall it was a lovely experience. The cocktails tasted great. The food was delicious and the host and waitress were very friendly. As it got busier, the service was a little slower and I do wish the prices were more reasonable considering how small the portions are (even for tapas). But overall, if you'd like to indulge on a special night out, this place was great.",4
"I was not very impressed with the drinks, the crowd or the vibe at this hip bar/lounge smack dab in the middle of the Mandalay Bay Casino.  I was surprised to see an older crown (mid 30's to 40's) dominate the scene, I guess that is my fault for showing up on a Thursday.  But come on, where I'm from or where I have lived in the past Thursdays are our raging nights ( so is Friday, Saturday, Sunday Funday, Monday, Tuesday, Hump Day you get the gist...).  You would think this place would be some what classy, not very much.  I didn't even wear my going out gear, all I wanted was a nice cocktail or 2 and spend time with my Mom after our drive from Denver.  Stratosphere had no bars to offer us so we jumped in a cab and hitched a ride to Mandalay.  I would have rather had cocktails sent up to us by room service.  The other classy looking bar near the entrance was closed.  We ordered 2 drinks, my Mom was looking for a decent Cab they offered her BV.  BV?  Are they serious?  That was $15 and my Greyhound Up was $15 as well.  After tip we were down $40.  Ha.  At least my mom won$200 from the dollar slots.  I never get those machines.",1
"We started shopping for a pool a little over a year ago.  We have met with Isaac at Mojave Blue  Pools as well as several other companies.  Mojave Blue was one of the best prices that already came with the variable speed pump, quartz finish, and LED lighting that every other company was charging extra for.  Isaac did not come across as a pushy salesman trying to get us to buy unnecessary upgrades or nickel and dining every little adjustment along the way.  It took us a year to finally decide to build the pool and met again with Isaac to go over our new design we wanted.  Once we signed the contract work started the following week.  The only thing we paid extra for was extending the concrete patio down the side yard a little ways.    Isaac also seemed genuinely interested in addressing any questions and concerns we had along the way.  The work was completed in a timely manner and now we are just waiting for warmer weather.  If I were to build another pool I would definitely call Mojave Blue Pools",5
"I ate here at the beginning of October with my mom and 2 of her friends. Before I met up with them, I was asked what steakhouses I would recommend. Gallagher's was not on my list. My mom's friend wanted to go to Gallagher's. After looking at the menu posted outside the restaurant, I was asked if the places that I had suggested were comparable in price/quality. I gave my opinion, but my mom's friend was ready to eat and just wanted to eat there. 
One of the ordered the pork chop, my mom and her other friend both ordered the filet mignon, and I ordered the rib eye. 
My mom's friend was having a very difficult time cutting her pork chop with the knife she was provided, so our waiter brought her a new one, but she still had a hard time. I thought that my rib eye was okay, but I definitely felt that I've had better. My mom said her filet was okay. I also had the wedge salad which was okay. There was something weird in it that did not taste good and I thought it was a piece of cheese at first, but the taste was so nasty it ruined the rest of the salad for me. 
I kind of wish that we had gone to one of the places that I had recommended, but it was okay. I don't really think that I will go back, and if I do, I will not get the wedge salad :(",3
"This is my Korean staple on campus. I always get the budae jjigae. Be warned, it is HUGE. Come during finals, as it is only a hop, skip and a jump off from the Union. They make great kimchi as well, especially the potato variety. With a huge main dish, two side dishes and unlimited tea at less than $10, this place is a jjigae dream. Cafeteria style seating, but so worth the delicious food. Give it a try and fall in love with the spicy soups.",5
"The veggie fajita lunch special here rocks! It also comes with free chips & salsa (although their salsa has absolutely NO spiciness, hence the 4 stars).

For vegans, get the:
veggie fajitas, no cheese
substitute guacamole for the cheese & sour cream
optional: a side of fresh jalapeno's (75 cents)

They tell me their tortillas are vegan, containing just flour, baking powder and one other non-animal ingredient (can't remember what they said).",4
"I ventured here randomly one day as I was waiting for a friend and needed some time to kill. 
The shop was very nicely decorated and clean, it gave a very indie/contemporary vibe to the atmosphere. I really like the fact how there was a lot of natural lighting in the shop, it made studying really enjoyable. As for the coffee, I ordered a dark roast and boy oh boy, it was very delicious. I'd definitely take a visit here again given that I am in the area.",5
Rene and Jesus arrived on time. Both of them were very professional and the chandelier came out perfect. This was also next day service BTW.,5
"I am giving this 2 stars, because I have to give it something. I am updating my previous review regarding the horrid treatment I received from the clueless hostess when I attempted to have dinner there last weekend. I did receive an e-mail from the manager asking me to call. I called him and he apologized profusely and asked for a chance to make things right. I plan on taking him up on his offer, because I really want to try this place out.",2
Everyone here is absolutely fantastic. They let me know if something needs to be replaced or if I can hold off. They are very accommodating and honest.,5
We were looking forward to this dining experience and left feeling completely unsatisfied.  The service was awful.  The appetizers and salad were all served at the same time.  The entrees arrived and  were fine but not excellent.  Some of the food was served cold and other entrees were served with the wrong sides.  One of us had to vacate our seat while the staff tried to light a propane heater.  Server made a decision to comp dessert which was appreciated but not enough to make up for the rest of the service and kitchen issues.  We will not be back.,3
"Stoped at this restaurant to get a chicken salad sandwich to go. I frequent Panera Bread when I am on the road as they are consistent in quality. What separates them is the staff. 

When I picked up my sandwich I placed the pager on the counter and stepped away with an ice tea in on hand and my sandwich bag in the other. The millennial behind the counter says, ""the pager goes in the basket"".  The pager is equidistant between us.  I hold up my hands to say, ""my hands are full could you help?""  He just glanced at the basket. I put the sandwich down and tossed the pager in the basket. Customer service at this store has its limits.",2
"Drove past this place the other night and made a note to stop by and check it out. Well tonight's the night. 

I must say that it's a modest, nicely laid out location with a small but good selection. 

That's about where the fun ends though. It hasn't been often that I've walked into a cigar shop (almost anywhere for that matter) where I haven't felt welcomed, but I have to say, this is one of those shops. I'm not sure if it's because of the great time I just had at Majerle's or if I was interrupting the game (which I came in to watch) but I simply ""wasn't feeling the love.""

I smoked an Arturo Fuente Hemmingway which was perfectly moist and relaxed with my iPad for most of my visit. The clerk (proprieter?) literally said three words to me the whole time ""cigar?,"" ""$9.99"" and ""Thanks.""  No offers of joining the rest of the guys, where you from?, what do you like to smoke?, not even ""Do you want to smoke here? Need matches, etc"" Although the guy after me at least got the last question. 

All in all, a pretty disappointing visit. Selection was ok, but I can find that anywhere along with a bit of camaraderie. Therefore I'll take my business and friends elsewhere next time. If you decide to check it out, I hope you have a more enjoyable time.",2
