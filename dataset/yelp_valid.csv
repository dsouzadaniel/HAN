"Good service. Good burgers. Crap fries (Susie Q) and overpriced, non-refill pop. Good if you have a few drinks in you already, but otherwise I spent the time waiting for my food noting the dust and grime build-up. 

Bathrooms are very clean!",2
The double-decker Chicago-style pizza is a winner!  The sauce is fabulous and it's cooked beautifully.  Well done!,4
"Service is horifically slow. Been there twice now, and both times orders have been incorrect. Staff is very friendly, but can't keep up with customers needs. Went with a colleague from Indiana, NOT even close to the quality of S&S out there. Manager did come over and offer shakes for compensation, but damage was already done.  Unfortunately will not be be back. Sorry folks.",1
"I don't think there's anything special about Cenci's, I'm sorry to say.  Groupon brought me here twice during the last few months, but a meal here is not a mistake I'm willing to make a third time.

I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks that even below-average pizza is good/decent pizza, or at least I had that mindset before I came to Cenci's.  The pizza here is pretty awful--commercial spongy crust, presumably inexpensive and greasy cheese, you get the idea.  And it's not even that cheap, particularly if you want to get a little creative and add toppings or do the build-your-own thing.  Unfortunately I had pizza both times I came here because I wanted to give the pizza a second try and the rest of the average bar food menu didn't exactly call my name.

Service during my experiences was OK, as were the White Russians.  The place hasn't much personality, and the clientele is diverse.",2
"Service was great, food was delish', atmosphere great... Patio... LOVED IT!

Went for dinner, looking fwd to trying the brunch on the patio before AZ heats up",4
"I've had breakfast here 3 times and it worth raving about! I cant wait to go back, the atmosphere is cool and funky and hip for this area!  Worth the drive. Busy on weekends.",5
"I hate this Store.  The battery in my iPhone 6 became corrupted and of course it's out of warranty.  So says the Apple tech guy I called.  He set me up an appointment to come to this Apple Store to have the battery replaced for $80.  Its either that or buy a new phone.  

So, I come here at the scheduled time.  It is always chaos in this Store because there are no signs, no one is sure where to go, is there a line? I finally found a line of people, still not sure what the heck I was supposed to do.  Finally talk to a guy who looked me up and found my appointment.  Set me up with a tech guy who then said we have no batteries in stock!  What!  What a waste of my time.  SO he says they will order one and email me when it gets here.  So I get the email a few days later, and it just says come in to the store.  No date by when or anything.  So I got the email Dec 5.  

I am here now and it is Dec 21.  I'm busy with work all week and kids on the weekends, I really don't have time to get to the mall.  But now I'm on vacation.  So anyway, again can't find a guy to talk to and then when I do, he says go talk to this person, blah, blah.  This person looks me up and the part and said I was supposed to be there within 5 days of getting the email, even tho the email had no dates in it.  So they returned my part to inventory and I would have to go back and get on the wait list.  I was so mad I couldn't talk at this point.

So, I get on the wait list and it's a 45 minute wait he says.  I bet that when I finally get to see a guy they are either going to say, oh we don't have any more batteries, you're screwed, OR ok we will fix, but it will be a couple hours.  I REALLY don't want to be at this freaking mall one more minute.  

But that's the Apple Store for you.  I never ever want to come here again.  I will update my review if anything magical happens, like if they actually make me happy for once, but it's not looking like it.",1
Awesome pizza! Absolutely love the one topping large special.  Usually quick service and very consistent.  Wish they didn't charge for their water downed ranch though.,4
"Inspired by Munich style beer halls, Wvrst opened mid last year in the Toronto King West area, serving up some exotic sausages and a wide variety of beers. I've been wanting to try this place since it opened and luckily I was able to find someone who was yet to have tried it.  Thanks for coming with me Justine H! In a nutshell, this place is like Oktoberfest, and now you can have it everyday at Wvrst!

Wvrst  definitely has flavours of a European sausage and beer hall, and really reminded me of Oktoberfest (except nicer). It's spacious and dimly lit with with ceiling strung lights --a casually comfortable place.

Wvrst Menu
Scattered around the hall tables were these long sheets of recycled paper which would be the menu. If you're looking for something other than fries, sausages, and alcohol, you're probably at the wrong place. The menu is simple, but the numerous options lie in the type of each you fancy.

At the back of the establishment there is a long open space that leads up to a rather small counter where you order and pay. I imagine this empty space is filled up by a line up during busier lunch hours. It wasn't too bad on the Tuesday night that we went.


Sausage Display Case
The display case is neatly organized with all the different sausages that they have. If you're in the mood for some exotic meats, then you're in luck. They have everything from kangaroo to venison, rabbit to guinea fowl. Justine H and I weren't too appetized looking at it, but after we managed to get over its appearance we went up to the counter to order.


Drinks
They have quite a number of beers here, bottled and on tap. Definitely not as many as a place like Beer Bistro might have, but more than just your commonly seen brews. Justine opted for the San Pellegrino Orange, and me an Austrailian beer Stiegl. Figured it was only fitting that I had a beer in the given setting!


Bratwvrst ($6) -Veal, Pork, and Wine
Duck ($9) -Maple and Fois Gras

These contemporary European sausages for the most part were quite good. Juicy and full of flavour. Didn't feel like I was eating a super artificial chunk of meat like I do having hot dogs from street vendors. In terms of flavour, I think it really depends on the sausage you order. You could definitely taste the fois gras in the Duck sausage, which was something Justine H didn't enjoy too much. I didn't mind it and found it to be an interesting combination, but I definitely liked the Bratwvrst more. I'd like to add that these sausages are quite small, and even with my small appetite I was unsatisfied having just the one hot dog.


Duck Fat Fries ($4.50)
Lots of other food enthusiasts raved about these fries, so we ordered a serving to share. Perhaps it was the heightened expectations from all the amazing reviews, but these duck fat fries fell just a bit short. They were full bodied, thick, and buttery, but they just weren't amazing. To be honest, I couldn't differentiate what difference the duck fat had on the fries compared to the ones made in regular oil. The order of fries comes with one dipping sauce, and the Wvrst Spicy we chose was great. Definitely not the best fries I've had, but they are quite tasty still, and would easily satisfy those random starchy fry cravings.


One last thing to note, is that they are big on leafs games here! They have a ticket giveaway at around 6:30pm the night of every Leaf's game at the Air Canada Center. With TV's all around the dining hall and tables that encourage conversation, it would be a great place to go catch the game along with a couple of drinks. But be warned, it might get pretty rowdy later in the night with cheering Leafs fans who've had a couple drinks or two!",3
"Thought to try this place out for the first time so got to-go order of goat masala, chicken seekh kabab and garlic naan.hugely disssapointed, they made goat curry and chicken kababs unexpectedly too salty and naan was burnt/over cooked.I immediately called them up to complain and response for salty goat curry was that ""We make it in huge quantity"", what does that even mean and how is that an excuse or justification for salty food. Such a waste of money, this place is so not upto expectations at all!",1
"This was a great show! Prices were reasonable for a same-day purchase of center-stage tickets, and the theater, which is attached to the Venetian hotel, felt modern and comfortable. Great drink service from inside the theater, too. The show comprises some outstanding acting, singing and dancing, and features a loose connection of the primary plot points of the Romeo + Juliet, Moulin Rouge and the Great Gatsby movies. The highlight of the show was a very impressive dancer, Alejandro, that was prominently featured throughout the show. Recommended!",5
"I am absolutely obsessed with Flower Child. It is the perfect option when you want some delicious healthy food! You can tell how much care goes into eat and every meal. My favorite is to get the grains plate and you can mix and match different options. I always lean towards the salmon, brussel sprouts, and sweet potatoes. I will also switch it up and get their amazing gluten-free mac & cheese! When I am on the go I will grab a flying avocado wrap but honestly you can't go wrong with anything!

Be sure to get a house squeeze lemonade too :] YUM",5
"This place is absolutely horrible when it comes to service. The food is okay. I sat down with two.other friends and waited over 30 minutes for our drinks. We finally order and my friend didnt like her sushi so she ordered a terriyaki bowl instead.. It took over 40 minutes for her to get her food, our sushi got all gross because obviously were not going to eat in front of her obivously. The waitress came back with the bowl and said.""im sorry the kitchen got backed up"" the grill side was already closed down. She was reLly rude never apologized just blamed it on the kitchen. At. One point i had to walk to the front to get a hostess to get our waitress because i was thirsty as hell and she was no where to be seen for another 30 minutes. I will never go back here. Worst service i have had.",1
Super cute with delicious and fresh fresh fresh homemade brunch/lunch options. Great portions. Save room for the banana pudding. Seriously.,5
We stayed there while bowling womens national tournament great room nice and quiet great food also recommend the Italian place great food.,4
"Food was great 2nd time here but this time around the service was a joke. Never did I see my server  she literally cane to take my order and that's only cus I had to go get someone, I ended up ordering 2 waters that I never got I ended up having to ask a different server. I was never even asked how everything was. Service was better my first time around . Hopefully next time they improve",3
"Workout is always changing this keeps it fresh.   Instructors are great and I like the balance between cardio and resistance.

Great atmosphere and range of fitness levels from Superhero to beginner.",5
Fast no wait seating on a Saturday night ...but be prepared to pay for substandard food!,2
The best breakfast place we have ever been to. Everyone is on top of everything. Our order never takes more then 15 minutes. The staff is always friendly. I highly recommend it :),5
"I wish I had great things to say about this place but I really don't. Yes, the room was nice and the lobby was hipster cool but having people look down their nose at you is not my cup of tea. From the moment we walked in I knew that our colorful tattoos and laid back lifestyle was going to clash with all the black tattoos and dick tight jeans.
Our bathroom barn door wouldn't slide close unless we both pulled on it. Everybody raves over the bathroom care products, we didn't have any. Housekeeping never stocked them or forgot to put them in there in the first place. We left one morning and was gone for HOURS only to come back to our room door OPEN! When we let the girl know at the front desk and all she said was ""oh, I'll let someone know.""
So from then on out housekeeping was locked out of our room till we left 3 days later. 
It is a nice hotel but I just don't think my husband and I were cool enough to be there.",3
"Better meat than most buffets I've had in the valley. Pretty new place, but the owners were previously owners of a different restaurant that was sold so seem to have the mixture and admin down right. Very nice people and good service. My favorite on the buffet was the goat---which is usually difficult to find. They did a good job and didn't skimp on the meat.",5
I love this place.. good good service is perfect and the glasses of wine are huge! I love authentic Chinese and this is where it's at. Mapo beancurd is amaizng they do have brown rice.. sweet and sour pork is what my son has and Mongolian beef.. I don't eat meat but they say it's good. Come try it out. It's a little dark in here and rather old school but i don't mind it's so yummy.,5
"After not finding any paczkis in the city that satisfied my requirements, I decided to head out to Amherst to stand in line for the famous delicacies from Kiedrowski's Bakery.  The drive was pleasant as the weather this Fat Tuesday was pretty mild.  Unfortunately, I used the Yelp mobile location map for directions and it took me to completely the wrong place.  After winding up on a residential road where I was pretty sure there wasn't a bakery, I was able to find where I was supposed to be heading.  Although, even with google maps this place was a bit hard to find for someone who had never been there before!

Lineup mid-day wasn't too bad, I only wound up waiting for about 25 min. outside and they had music playing, coffee to purchase and a little heater to warm up next to.  A lady at the front door kept order by ushering the appropriate amount of people inside as soon as there was room to hold them.

A dozen paczkis for $10?  Even though there were only two of us that I was buying for, there was no way I could say no to that deal!  Traditional flavours, so I was really happy and got 3 each of the prune, poppyseed, rose petal and apricot.  Their cases were filled with paczkis for this day but I did see some cakes and breads sitting back there and I'll have to come out and try some of their other baked goods.

Lets just say that it was a miracle that those 12 paczkis made it back home to Cleveland without my digging into the box...the smells coming from my passenger seat were unbelievable!  Once at home, we immediately went for our favorites, prune was light and delicate, and the apricot was heavenly.  I can say that all of the flavours exceeded expectations and they are easily some of the best paczkis I have EVER had.  No wonder Kiedrowski's has a Paczki Ball every year and sells thousands of these on Fat Tuesday!  There will be no question in the future where I will be going to get paczkis....the drive out to Kiedrowski's is worth it  ;o)",5
The food was perfectly seasoned and fresh as can be. This is a must restaurant to try and favorite! Side note: it is BYOB.,4
"Nice rooms.  Great view from your own private balcony.  The amenities are just ok and you are off the beaten path.  Was checked into a room on the 52nd floor, unfortunately they were doing construction on the room above.  Woke up to jack hammers every morning.  I just don't think the staff understand that you should not book rooms below construction.  Might come back again but there are better values.",2
I was very disappointed with the cupcakes I bought. I bout 2 to go before my show at Playhouse. I got the strawberry and blue velvet. The cupcakes looked delicious in the case but I was a little hesitant to pay 4 dollars for a cupcake. YOLO right? I couldn't decide which one to get so I got 2. When I got home I took a bite of the blue velvet. The cream cheese frosting was the best part. But the cake was so dry. I immediately had to wash it down with a drink. I tried the other and unfortunately I was singing the same tune.. wha wha wha. Disappointing. I was better off just getting one of their cupcake milkshakes so you can wash it down  smoothly as a delicious drink. Not worth my 8 dollars and the long time I waited in line that wasn't that long but only had 2 girls working the counter who were both making milkshakes. Leaving no one at the checkout. I can get way better cupcakes from heinens just as big if not bigger and a dollar less. I will not be back.,2
"A solid four and half stars based on food only.  If anyone likes Chinese BBQ food with rice for a quick lunch, or even quick dinner, this is the place to buy take out.  See my photos with star rating.  

Also I believe it uses good quality rice, it taste good, unusual for a take out BBQ house.  The other BBQ houses that I had eaten, the rice were not very good.",4
Terrible! Worst service I've ever had- waitress was rude and argued with me when she messed up our order. Soft drinks tasted bad and food was mediocre at best. Definitely will not be coming back!,1
The combo packages are surprisingly big!  Meat lovers for 4 was enough to leave 4 people VERY full.,5
Wonderful experience.   My husband and I heard about Metro Diner on Channel 13 and wanted to give it a try.  Rick was our server and was very attentive and had Great customer service skills.  The food is worth every penny.   With the Chicken and Waffles you get half a chicken with waffles topped with strawberry butter.  The chicken was seasoned like my grandmother would season hers.  We took so much food home that was left over.  Great atmosphere also.  We will DEFINITELY decided returning.,5
"Instead of a tasty, well cooked, burger (I ordered medium-rare), I got an overcooked, dry, tasteless burger.  I went to Harry's on a night that was not overly crowded.  I ordered their burger (one of their 'favorites' items.  It was supposed to be a good burger with better cuts of meat than you would find in a cheaper burger.

For a restaurant of this price ($20 for just a burger/tax/tip?) I would expect something quite a bit tastier.",1
Awesome customer service!  Very informative and great prices!  Would recommend to everyone!  They always take great care of my Mini Cooper!,5
"Amazing store in the District and just steps from Green Valley Ranch Hotel and Casino.  I've come to this store more times than I can count and well, now that I am on Yelp I think it only fair to give my two cents.

Upon entering this great little store I was greeted by one of the owners.  She welcomed me in and walked over to see if I needed some assistance.  Since I was just wandering by after having a late breakfast across the way I thanked her and said I'd see her at the register.  

This is the type of store that once you walk in you can't walk out without finding something awesome to take home.  I would love for the owner to come to my house and decorate exactly as she has in this store.  It's a unique mix of home furnishings & wall hangings to Alex and Ani bracelets to specialty baby items like beautiful baby bags and clothing.  There are some really beautiful angel wings hanging on the wall.  So freaking awesome!  Today I found my bestie the cutest most comfortable pair of slippers.  When I say cute I am talking soft and cushiony with the most gorgeous fat ribbon bow on top with beautiful crystals adorning the bow. So unique and special.  I also picked up a few of their food items.  My mom loves scones so I got a box of scone mix and some specialty jam.  

This store is special because they offer things you can't find just anywhere.  They sell the little touches of comfort you place around your home to make it more personal.  Prices are very reasonable and the service here is great.  They make you feel like family!

Parking is a breeze as you can park in front of the store or behind.  It's such a pleasant center and the ambiance both inside and outside the store is so great.  Can't wait to come back and see what they come up with next as I overheard they were adding a bunch of new items over the next few days!",5
Aneta Neagu is such a pro. You must go see her. She is priced very competitively. She does rush jobs too if you are in a bind. I showed up at 11am and she had a jacket done by 4pm. She is the best. Total pro. Very responsive and helpful. Go see her at 2401 E. Osborn Rd.,5
"I have been to Erin's a few times.  Rhonda always suggests it and I say no.  After about a year between visits I forgot how bad it was and said yes.  The food is not awful, it is greasy and low in flavor.  The prices are high.  

Rhonda had the fried bluegills and they were greasy and left a film in your mouth.  I had a couple of bites and wished I hadn't.  It took a few hours before the film and taste went away.

I had Mediterranean pasta with chicken.  I know, you don't go to a Irish Pub for pasta.  I thought it would be easy for them to make but I was wrong.  The pasta was overcooked and the sauce was lacking flavor.  I thought having kalamata olives and sun dried tomatoes would make it flavorful but I was wrong.

Hopefully this review will remind me not to go back and drop $60 on food I don't like.",2
"What happened? I remember coming to this place for the first time and it was filled to the brim. Food was excellent and service was spectacular. A highlight being the fried chicken skins. Well...not so much this time round. A very clear indication of our not-so-good time was an almost empty restaurant, odd seeing how it was a Friday night. The food was bland. Their current menu, lackluster. They removed a lot of great dishes, like the Ham hock, and replaced them with ""I could get this anywhere else"" dishes. Service was awful. The server was arguing with another co-worker. They ran through their supply of soda for the night, which we were comped for, the server ran through and poured what was left into our cups, letting us know all the while (we were not offered something else to drink). Our food came out at odd times and we were left alone, no check ups on refills or a ""how is the food?.""  We had ordered some other drinks when our server happen to walk our way....actually glad she forgot someof our order, considering how everything tasted. Hah, nothing could redeem Okra that night, not even the chicken skins.",1
"Damn the pizza is good! Bring it with pepperoni and ricotta, a couple of side salads and boneless wings and I'm good. It's about once a week for delivery.

UPDATE: The food is becoming more erratic from Caliente. The wings arrived tough. Again. The broccoli puffs got you the extra star.",2
"We planned our Vegas wedding in less than 2 months, so we were concerned about not having the time to do our homework on choosing our services. We contacted a few photographers who were all busy (of course!) but one of them recommended Marni. I checked her out online but think that after speaking with her, I knew she was a perfect fit for us. She was easy to speak with and very positive.
On our big day, she was prompt, professional, courteous and not to mention TALENTED! I can't post any pics just yet but hope to do so in the future. In the meantime, JUST CALL HER!  Thanks again Marni!",5
"Well its French--circa 1960--tired, uninventive, cholesterol packed fare at dinner. Its true fat and salt can make anything taste good, but perhaps stick with spam. Emblematic of the experience was greeting the three employees at the host stand with, ""Bon soir, comment vas tu?"" and receive puzzled expressions and no response all around.",2
Everyone seemed friendly. Husband had no appointment and they said at least 1.5 hours. The only issue I had was its 61 out side but they has it freezing inside. I had to go wait in the car with the heater on so I could warm back up.,4
Best pizza ever hands down!! I've been coming here for pizza for over 5 years now and not once has it been bad. It taste just as amazing every time. If you're near it and want a really good slice of pizza I highly recommend this place! Plus it's hella cheap and they have more than just pizza.,5
This place really is as ratchet as it gets. Staying here for 3 nights and my room hasn't been cleaned. Nor have I gotten any fresh towels. Oh and I have a low-fi tube TV in my room? Really?,1
Had the tapas. Amazing food very good portions. I recommend the artichoke. If your into strong wine aroma in your food this is a place for you.,5
"Good burgers, angus beef, no hormones or antibiotics. We ordered single cheeseburgers which were good but are very small. Husband ordered a second one and said he will order a double next time. Peanut butter milkshake is excellent. The whip cream must be Cabots from Vermont, creamy and delicious. Best milkshake I have had in a long time. The fries were disappointing, crinkle type,very generic, no taste. Will skip these next time. Good seating, TV's in the eating area. Very clean restaurant. Restaurant faces Camelback Road not Scottsdale Rd as others said. Good parking.",4
This place has been shut down by the city. Now they won't return my my calls regarding the money I've paid fit my November wedding.,1
"Caffeine & gambling......mmmmm   Located inside the MGM casino so you can stay up later and what else ""roll the dice""",3
"When one is considering breakfast there are a myriad of different directions you could go. Pancakes places, bakeries, a cafe, and so on. But when you find a place that takes everything thing in the freaking kitchen and throws it on a biscuit YOU HAVE TO GIVE THAT PLACE A SHOT. 

Now a quick disclaimer, I am not a biscuit fan. They are always too dry and make me choke. They give me flashbacks to church potlucks dinner where some old lady brought ham biscuits that she froze from her wedding reception in 1925. However, my wife is a biscuit fan, and we have a hotel room with no kids for the weekend...so I chose the biscuit place. And I didn't regret it. 

These are not funeral ham biscuits. Those freaking biscuits melted in my mouth. I got the chicken and bacon egg and cheese biscuit. Holy crap! Bread never tasted so good! I wish we lived closer. I would hit this place up every Saturday. The beignets were off the hook! And the coffee was amazing. The atmosphere was awesome, I wish we had eaten there, but bringing breakfast back to my wife in bed was a just a little bit better. 

If you are looking for breakfast or just freaking good food...go here!",5
"Called them up and I spoke with Gina the own who was very professional and pleasant to speak too. Made an appointment that was 30mins before there closing time, but she made an exception since I had work and couldn't make it in sooner. Joanna took care of me and I must say I am very pleased. Was a bit higher price then I was accustomed to Loc Retwist, but definitely worth it.",4
"Met the head chef Shane or Forrest, whatever his name was. You would think he walked on water the way he treated you. Great music, cheap drinks, but don't expect much else.",1
By far the worst McDonalds I've ever been to. The restaurant is always filthy dirty. The staff is rude and inept. They never get the order correct and when you call them on it they are unapologetic. Unfortunately people still go there simply because of the name. The management of this location should be ashamed.,1
"Annie's is an excellent Restaurant! Annie and staff are amazing, always putting their customers 1st and will do whatever it takes to make sure that you are happy!  Also will go well and beyond for customers that have disabilities or any special needs! I also have severe foods allergies, Annie  & Staff always make sure they get my order correct and have no problems cooking exactly what I can eat!",5
"We love Hopdoddy, mainly because they have such an amazing happy hour! It includes a $5 burger, $5 fries, $5 drinks, etc. Hubby and I can get a meal and drinks for $25 out the door! Their burgers are great and their shakes are AMAZING too! Also love that their beer mugs are frozen so you get that layer of freeze on top of your beer :) Highly recommend!",5
"Very good food, service..i ordered the ""Marinated Pork"" very good..minus one star for the weird table setup and soda machine location...but the counter girls were very helpful and pleasant..",4
There was something off about this recent. None of the staff had a genuine smile or outgoing friendliness during the entire time we were eating in the location. I am a big fan of INNOUT and expected better service.,3
"Absolutely horrible customer service. I've called this place with the phone number they have in order to make an appointment the tunes a well for the last month. I get no response and the phone number ALWAYS goes to a recording. I've left messages, but I don't even think it's an actual voice mail. 

I bought this experience through Groupon and have made every reasonable attempt to contact this business with no success. I will be returning my Groupon for a refund and will make sure no one I know ever uses this business.",1
"Wvrst!! Ahh, I could wax poetic about this place. We first tried to come to wvrst to catch the Germany v Mexico match, but it was fully at capacity with tons of fans, so we came back later for lunch, which I'm super glad we did! 

The atmosphere is based on a German beer hall, so expect wide communal tables, benches and a DIY service atmosphere - there's no table service here (they do drop your food off) and you order your food and drinks at the bar/ kitchen respectively. I would say this place is the best with a group - we went with three people and I think it would be even better with more. 

They have a really interesting selection of sausages - our group tried the Merguez, Oktoberfest and Bison sausages. Our ranking was the folllwing: Oktoberfest, Bison & Merguez, with the suprise stand out being the bison! There is a nice simple selection of toppings including onion, sweet pepper and sauerkraut, along with ketchup and three types of mustard at the tables. We also split  some pretzels (which can be purchased singly or in a platter of 3) which came with an intense nose clearing spicy dijon mustard, and a large side of duck fat fries (which comes with your choice of two dipping sauces: we had kimchi mayo and sweet chili) 

Wvrst has an excellent menu selection for the adventurous eater, or someone who just wants a classic German wurst experience - and with a 3-page beer list and an AWESOME selection of cider, I can't wait to eat here again!",5
"1.  The food is good
2. Besides Garrett's weight, he also needs to lose his attitude.

If you're planning to eat here, make sure you ask for a different server if you happen to have Garrett.  #foodisgoodbutservicesucks #WriteUpGarrett

Garrett was ok to begin-- not great, but ok.  Unfortunately, he quickly deteriorated to just short of surly.  He was impatient in his responses, not very attentive and sighed regularly when we spoke to him.  At the end of our meal he asked if we wanted dessert (again, impatiently) and then was rushing us to decide (""Yes or Nor?!?!"") and took off when we said no thanks at that point. Since he rushed off so quickly we didn't have a chance to tell him we needed to split our bill, then when he returned and we asked to split our bill he sighed again, then said, ""You should have told me before,"" followed by a fake laugh as though it was a joke.  One of our party-- a waitress herself-- said, ""We'll do it, just hand it here.""  After he walked off, she was grousing about his poor attitude and he stuck is head back in and asked, ""Did you call me?""  TOTALLY passive-aggressive.  Then when he returned with our split bills, he had completely ignored how we'd marked it and just randomly split the items into 2 bills.  The waitress member of our party went to find him to have him fix it and found him sitting at the bar top, where he ignored her until realized she wasn't leaving. He finally came back with our correct bills and stood over us, ""Are these right now?""  We put our credit cards in and he left.  Then he sent some blonde lady in with the copies for us to sign.  Clearly since he knew he was getting a mandatory gratuity, and only one member of our party ordered an alcoholic beverage, he didn't even try to give us good service.  We are an easy going group and didn't need impeccable service, but there are so many options in Vegas that we certainly feel impatient, passive-egressive, condescending service is unacceptable.",1
"It's a good restaurant. Lots of flavor, and the Thai sausages are awesome when served with ginger and peanuts.",4
Authentic Hunan dishes. This is a place you definitely should go if you like spicy food.,5
"I'm obsessed with their egg drop soup, it tastes fresh and like they actually made it there compared to other places that taste almost frothy and powdery. For the price you pay, you get great quality food and good sizes.",5
"We have been using Bulwark's services for 6 months. We have never had an experience with any part of their business that wasn't exemplary. They come out the very next day every time we report that we need their services. Dylan was our tech today and went above and beyond our expectations. He was on time, friendly, and informative. We appreciate his help! We look forward to doing business with Bulwark for years to come.",5
"This Starbucks is pretty slow and unfriendly.  I, like someone else, tried to use a free drink that I had earned but they told me they don't do that.. Hmm however you take my money from my Starbucks card.. 
At least try to be emphatic about not accepting my free drink reward, don't have an attitude. 
Anyways, if you're craving Starbucks it'll do.",2
"Because of their massive amount of reviews and high rating we wanted to try out on a Sat night. 
Food:
We ordered premium combo and they didn't serve us oysters and scallops. We did a lot of talking during dinner and didn't pay attention if they served the right food. We found out after we left and this is not cool. Can we say they treat on their menu? The Kobe carpaccio didn't look as good as the picture. And their shrimp Bibimbap tasted horrible. 
Service:
I understand Sat is always awfully busy. So we ended up eating without drinks. Finally we got our drinks on the halfway of our dinner. BTW, they use very cheap wine to make Sangria. I can't taste the difference but my friend is a wine expert. :(",2
"NOT GOOD PIZZA. I can't hate them for making it cheap (that's why I went there), but it's probably the most bland excuse for pizza I've ever had...the first time I've ever been unenthusiastic about finishing leftover pizza.

Service was fine, and it was quick - it's just not very good food. If your only care is filling your stomach on $5, then this place is for you. If you are actually looking for something that tastes good, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. There are plenty of other pizza joints around that are a million times better.",2
"Minh Chau has no-fuss service, a decent selection, and they clearly understand the value of repeat business. We've now had two pairs of lenses and one complete set of glasses done there, and it's all gone smoothly: good products and a pleasant experience each time.",4
"Fave sushi restaurant in the area!
Service is on point! Nice waitresses & very accommodating! 

Price is on point too (during lunch- which is 11pm to 4pm. They offer lunch combos which are priced from $8-$13)

But it gets pricier at dinner for the same items. So make sure you try and go for Lunch.

Ordered all different kind of bentos and I MUST SAY THAT BEEF KALBI BENTO was the best of them all. Tender and flavourful!!!! You can also ask if you want your tempuras to be all shrimp or all vegetables (at no extra charge).  Need I say more?",5
"This place has such low ratings, but I enjoyed it. It is 24 hours which is great! I could fulfill my hawaiian food craving anytime. 

The inside of the restaurant is nice and clean.  Lots of space, not crowded at all.  You order up in the front and then you could choose to sit inside on booth or table, or even do take out.  We decided to sit in.  I craved for Longanisa so I got that for only $5 and my friend got the kalbi combo plate for $10.  Score!! My plate came with 2 eggs, 2 scoops rice, & 3 sausages sliced in half (typically comes with 2 in Hawaii).  Her plate had thin sliced kabli almost resembling jerky, teri chicken, and chicken katsu, 2 scoop rice, and 1 scoop mac salad.  It would cost about $15-$20 back home! But everything was good.  Definitely made me miss the food at home but i found this place! 

Bathroom was also clean!!!",4
Prices were high and the food is nothing special. We drove a little over an hour to get here and were disappointed..,2
"This bakery was near our place in Montreal.  After checking out the review I decided to give this place a try. Small mom and pop place, they seem to have a variety of bread (did not try). I was A little disappointed at the almond croissant (flake of the croissant was hard and the feeling was very sweet and this was 9am), the cheese croissant was a little tastier.",3
Some of the best pizza in Vaughan! The thin crust dough is outstanding. It's in a location that's not visible from the street but definitely worth going to.,5
"If not for our wonderful friendly server I would give zero stars. Food was horrible.  My husband ordered roadhouse salad, costs something like $14 she brings it with no meat 40 minutes later. So we complain. They bring him 5 small pieces of meat.   I had the pulled pork stuffed sweet potato, burned potato, old leftover pork, not worth your time or money to go there. Pick another place.",1
"Biscuits is a great breakfast/lunch place. Be prepared to wait on Sat/Sun mornings but it' always been worth it. Friendly but busy staff, free coffee while you wait and they always say they are sorry for making you wait.  

The decor is back home country. Reminds me of my grandma's kitchen. 

The food is good, and a huge plus for having chicken fried chicken for breakfast, that means no more having to go to nasty cracker barrel for it!  

I love the country gravy, love the chicken fried chicken. The grits seem pre-sweetened and I can see how people might not like that, myself I am all good with that. Now the one downer is the Biscuits, I am not a huge fan, they are huge and heavy. I myself like the lighter ones. 

I've had breakfast and lunch items both there and all have been lovely. My best friend swears by the corned beef hash, he orders it as an add on to everything and anything he gets there. 

You can eat and get beyond full for two for about 20 bucks and that is a huge plus for me. 

The only bad thing we ever got there was a cinnamon roll for my son. He said it was nasty and couldn't get past one bite, he said it tasted like a hard roll with some funky icing.  I have never myself tried it but it didn't look that good honestly. But hey, if that is the only minus for them I am ok with that!

I would totally suggest getting over here and give them a try, they are also open late on Friday and Sat's for fish frys!",4
"Khotan sucks as a place to eat. The girls and I went to this place for ""Dinner"" but really all we got was appetizers. We went during happy hour so it was suppose to be cheaper, but it don't mean the size is bigger. I ordered some spicy tuna and it was $7 for like a tiny portion that didn't do anything for me at all. The roll were so tiny it was about the size of a quarter and I got four of those. BOO times 2. The only reason this place got two stars out of me was the bartender. They both were entertaining and he gave us some drinks for free. Atmosphere is really not impressive either.",2
"Excellent delicious food that is a tad bit over priced. Sometimes has long waits. But if you're in the hood and ready to drop some coin on what is essentially a small sandwich, salad or soup then this is the bomb!",4
Too expensive. Couldn't understand the agent. Don't get ripped off on insurance. They tried to give me a mustang convertible when I wanted an economy,2
"Nice little Mexican restaurant.  I like Mexican food a lot.  Don't get me wrong, this is a great little spot, but nothing to particularly write home about, in my book.  I got a taco salad, which was a lot bigger than I was expecting.  However, the shell was fried and very greasy and not the baked tortilla shell that it seemed in the menu's picture.  Other than that, it was all around a great little joint.  Felicidades a los dueños por este restaurante!  Que Dios los bendiga!",4
"If i could give this place 10 stars i would!! The best best best cookies i have ever had! The family that owns it is just as sweet as there cookies. It is also a store for knick knacks and even furniture. Thank you so much for doing it right, from the perfect cookies to the friendliest staff!",5
"$240.00 New Patient FEE
$122.00 ""Surgery""
$65.00 Binocular microscopy
-------------------------------------
$427.00 TOTAL

This is what my bill looked like after going in to have some earwax removed.  EARWAX!  If you want to be rushed through your visit and then overcharged, this is the place for you.  Had they mentioned there would be a $240.00 new patient fee, I would have turned on my heel and walked out of there.  When I called and asked for the undisclosed fee to be reduced or removed, they refused.  Not sure how they get away with this.",2
"Let the raving begin!

I love cheese and this place has an impressive selection. The sales staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and will let you sample as many cheeses as you'd like before you buy. Beware though, they are a bit on the pushy side and you may come out with more cheese than you had originally planned (which really is never a bad thing).

In addition to cheeses they also have oils and vinegars, olives, deli meats and crackers. With a place like this so close by I don't think I will ever buy cheese from the grocery store again.",4
Holy yummy cow batman. This is my 2nd trip yo this establishment.  Was great both times. The eaitstaff is friendly and attentive and the dress code is casual wich is really nice for a vegss steakhouse.  Porterhouse cooked exactly right. Green beans are good as are the smashed taters. The folks next to me had the prime rib and it looked great too. I will be back.,5
"We purchased a 2007 Yukon XL from another valley dealer but decided to have GMC Henderson service it since they are closer.

The service personnel were friendly and helpful.  I bought a 3-pack of oil changes which was a good deal and I like that they are looking for ways to save customers a little money! The service itself did not take too long and they finished a lot faster than I expected. I appreciated it that they provide a courtesy wash of the exterior.

When the front parking light required the front bumper to be removed and a $4 bulb ended up costing us $150 in labor costs, the service manager was very helpful to negotiate the price down to a more reasonable rate.",4
"Wonton noodle soup is what people come here for, and it's great! 

Satisfying portions, delicious taste, and good value is what keeps me coming back to Jim  Chai Kee.

Try paying a little extra to get the wonton lo mein (noodles with no soup) version, which also comes with some oyster sauce on top. A nice alternative to the the noodle soup!

The restaurant is clean and has friendly staff, especially the guy who collects money at the cash register. What a friendly guy! However, there are better places to bring a first date.

There is free parking in the outdoor plaza but it could be challenging to find a spot during peak eating times (lunch, dinner)

You can get some free hot tea in the back yourself.",4
"He's the nicest eye doctor ever :D
Visit are always quick and easy
He is closed on Sunday and Monday 
Open Tuesday-Thursday and Saturday at 10-6:30pm 
Then
Friday 1-5pm",5
I was just not that impressed with the sandwiches.  I would rather buy the baguette they make there (the kids enjoy watching that) and make my own sandwiches at home.,3
"Stayed this weekend for the marathon. Wanted to write a review and single out Anthony at the front desk for his great personality, service, and welcoming smile. Room was huge and clean, breakfast was great, and the location was convenient for the race. I would definitely recommend and go back.",5
Sugar slam!! I stumbled onto this place as I was looking for a very quick snack to quell my rumbling tummy. I was so happy to see they had my favorite- macarons for $1.50! They were not super delicate melt in my mouth but i would definitely get them again. They also have cookies and cupcakes for that 4 o clock sugar fix. The owner is super friendly and talkative. I tried one cupcake (white chocolate frosting with red velvet cake) and it was heavenly. Looking forward to trying them again soon.,4
"Not bad dollar value for where you are. Menu if kid of small in selection, but they cover the bases. I had   the burger. Fries were cold, and burger was not as hot as I thought it should be. 
The beef brisket was not hot, but it was a ok.
Waiter was right on.",3
"I was eating there on Sunday June 7 with my family. The atmosphere of the restaurant was really relaxing. Very classy. The waiters were very careful when serving. I ordered the 12 Oz filet. It was AMAZING, the best steak I have every had. I also had the lobster mash potatoes, that was also a very delicious choice. I couldn't finish it all, but shared it. I was very satisfied when I left. They also provided us with a vanilla yellow cake with cream cheese, topped with vanilla ice cream,  strawberries and oranges with homemade whip cream. I loved it! I am definitely going back again!",4
"I was delighted over Christmas to see a Dunkin' Donuts in Phoenix.  Their coffee was good, their donuts were fresh, and the service was ok.  One time I came here they were out of a lot of options, which is always disappointing, but that happens at all bakery/donut places.  And they sell Dunkin' K-Cups here which is great!",4
"It's a buffet so what do you expect out of the waiters ?  Out of the 3 that we had, 1 was a dick and the other 2 were alright.  But at the end of the day, we got what we wanted and they did their job.  So who gives a fuk if they don't exactly treat you like a king?

Went there with a party of 8 for an all you can keep extravaganza.  We probably ate 2 cows worth.  Sure, we had to ask probably 2-3x for each item, but we got what we wanted.  Quality of the meats aren't exactly grade-A, but again, its a BUFFET!  Don't expect amazing quality for 20 bucks of all you can eat!

Overall, we all enjoyed the food very very much and left there FULL.  Thats the point right?",4
"Here is a totally and honest review. My family and I went here for dinner a couple of days ago. The place was a major fail. We came here because we had a Restaraunt.com coupon worth $10.00 off of 20.00 or more. We sat down and it took them more than 15 minutes to bring water to our table and that was after asking 3 people for water. We then picked our meals off the choices that were on the menu only to be denied these items due to them being only lunch items(no where on the menu did it say that they were for lunch only). We ordered the orange chicken and the pork chow mein. -FAILED on both items.  They brought out the chow mein first after about a half hour in the place which by the way had no AC in it. Their excuse for that was they were getting it repaired soon!  Remember this was pork chow mein but my dish had hardly any meat in it, roughly about 6 tiny julien slices of pork about 1 inch long. secondly the noodles looked like over sized worms and covered with lots of onions and maybe bamboo shutes. It had ZERO flavor PERIOD.  Next our orange chicken came out about ten minutes later and it was disgusting. Zero flavor,no aroma and nothing but a few pieces of meat that I don't know if they were even chicken. Most of the pieces were very mushy and fatty like most of it being the deep fried chicken fat and skin. Down right nasty.  Now here comes the third strike. When it came time to pay I gave them a credit card and my $10.00 coupon and they would not accept it. (Reason they gave us was that they were under new management as of today the day we came in to eat and the new management was going to cancel these coupons. They offered to take 3.00 off and I told them to charge me whatever they wanted to charge me as I knew I would never be coming back to this place. FOLKS, be WARNED THAT THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE! Look at the past reviews, I know now that I should have believed the reviews I had read before going there, Like a big dummy I wanted to try it for myself !!!!!!!!! what a mistake!  GO at your own risk. It's to bad that Yelp does not offer a minus 1 star.",1
"Most definitely my favorite west side Sushi spot! 

The sushi is always fresh and tasty! The prices during happy hour are excellent! 

The ambiance is chic and trendy. 
Just love love Tomo's!!!",5
"While visiting for a conference, I stopped by during happy hour and had one of their $6 margaritas - even though it was 3 minutes until 6, the bartender was super friendly and offered the HH menu. I also ordered their chips with salsa roja and a Mexico City Quesadilla (neither on the HH menu as I chose to steer away from it for my food because I had my heart set on a quesadilla). Both were perfectly sized for happy hour time and the quesadilla was delicious. The chips and salsa were average - I don't know many places that can make these stand out, so that's not a negative to me. Overall, the food was fantastic, service was great and the outside bar area was neat.",5
Great gyros. Kids loved them. Meat was big flavorful and juicy. I will be back,5
Try a sandwich on a bagel.  Delicious.  Also the coffees and teas are made well.  Mostly it is a pleasant space to look around and just hang out at.  Bring a deck of cards or backgammon and just chill.,5
"Got the mediterranean pita with chicken to go. It was delicious, and had a nice kick to it. Their tzatziki sauce is bangin'. My order only took a few minutes to make (granted it was 4 PM so I was the only one there). Service was fast & friendly. I'm surprised this place isn't busier nor has more reviews--it's really good and the rest of the menu looks great. I'll definitely be going back to try more.",5
"These people are horrible as a service .I called in and was setting up service with them they told me they could give me 20 megs to my house threw fiber optic I called cox canceled my service with them waited a week for CenturyLink to set up services with no Internet and on the day they where supposed to hook up my service they told me they can't give me the service I signed up for took the day off work went and bought a modem the day I signed up with them so not to lease theirs all for no reason and I already knew better I have been a tech here in Las Vegas for 15 years and have heard all the horror stories but figured I'd give them a shot anyway the worst waist of time ever.My neighbor signed up with them a few months ago and turned in their equipment the next day .I noticed the truck in front of their house all day I'm close to my neighbors so figured I'd go out their and see what was going on and actually had to teach their guy how to install the phone lines .I can't be love their such a cracker jack operation .I worked for AOL in the 90 Earthlink in early 2000 and CDW before I started my own Company and everyone should be warned I wouldn't recommend anyone to use their services. Personally I have been in thousands of people homes around town working on their computers and can't say I have ever heard anyone say I have CenturyLink and I love it so be warned and don't waist you're time you where smart enough to look for reviews don't second guess you're self it's not worth the time and effort they just don't have it together the people on the phone don't know what they are talking about they just want to sing you up at all costs doesn't matter if they lie to you they just need the mark on their board and to close the deal and leave it to the rest of the workings of the company to straighten it out .I feel sorry for the techs that have to work for these Idiots the tech that tried to set up my services actually knew his stuff and deserves a better job with a better company I'll give credit where it's due and CenturyLink as a whole doesn't even deserve 1 star just a complete mess had to go back to cox after having many heated phone calls about their pricing but at least their service works.DONT WAIST YOU'RE TIME WE ARE STUCK WITH COX......

"It's a great place for breakfast solid 3 stars. It's nice to have someplace new in the area! The waitress wasn't overly nice, and really rushed us expecting us to have our order ready as soon as we sat down. Came back 2 minutes later waiting for us to place the order. Not sure why since the place wasn't very busy at all. The food was great! We ordered the million dollar bacon which was basically just bacon with syrup on it lol too pricy for what it was, but it was pretty yummy! I had the lemon pancakes with ricotta cheese and strawberries! It was so good! I'm still craving it now. See photos for more information.",3
This place is such a hole in the wall but a must to check out. It's tiny but the food is good! I love their micheladas! I do think service could be a little quicker. There's been a few times where it's like come onnnnn. But that's really my only complaint. I've had different dishes & they're all good. I personally like the tostadas and cocktails.,4
"So me and the bf checked this out on our recent Vegas trip.  Food was excellent!  The complimentary French fry trio was amazing, each type of French Fry comes with it's own sauce.  The bf had a steak and I had the Salmon.  I don't eat meat but his steak looked pretty good, he certainly seemed to be enjoying it.  My salmon was excellent and the roasted lemon that came with it was perfect to squeeze on the fish.  StripSteak has several side dishes to choose from and we ordered the Mac and Cheese based on our waiters recommendation.  The waiter said this was enough for 2 people, I'd have to say it was enough for at least 4 since we had the fries and entrees.  Dinner was amazing and unfortunatly we skipped dessert.  However we managed to roll back to our room a few places down and recover from our Food Comas.

Also this place is currently has gift certificates on Restaurant.com.  I got a $50 gc a while back when they were doing a 80% off promo and had no problem using this for our meal.",4
